"""Ephemeral, read-only branch-preview server for QAMC Mission Control.

Lets an operator view the CURRENT feature branch's frontend (whatever is
actually committed in this `dev` checkout — both the legacy `/ui` dashboard
and the new `/cockpit` React build) rendered against real, truthful QAMC
data, without duplicating or faking any runtime state and without touching
the `qamc` production account in any way.

How it gets real data: every JSON API request (anything other than /ui/*
or /cockpit/*) is proxied read-only, GET-only, to the already-running
`qamc` production Mission Control API on 127.0.0.1:8800 (reachable over
loopback regardless of account boundary — that is how this repo's own
frontend-verification tooling already reads live data; see
docs/verification/stage-6-react/README.md). This process never reads
`qamc`'s SQLite database or credentials directly (it has no filesystem
permission to — the `dev`/`qamc` account boundary is unaffected), never
writes anything, and never starts, stops, or restarts any `qamc` service.

Version skew: this branch adds backend surface production hasn't deployed
yet (`/account.liquidity`, `/positions[].direction`, `GET /runs/{id}/funnel`).
Rather than leave those panels blank, the fields/endpoints that are missing
upstream are reconstructed here from data upstream ALREADY exposes, using
the exact same pure derivation rules and typed schemas this branch's own
backend uses (see the reconstruction helpers below for the specific source
each one mirrors) — never fabricated, and self-obsoleting: once production
actually has the field/route, the real upstream value passes straight
through untouched. `GET /prices/{symbol}` is the one exception — real bars
require Alpaca market-data credentials this `dev`-account process
deliberately does not have, so that one degrades honestly instead (empty
bars + an explanatory `error` string), per the project's "unknown stays
unknown, never fabricated" rule.

Safety boundaries:
- GET-only, enforced in this process's own middleware BEFORE a request is
  ever forwarded upstream — belt-and-suspenders on top of the upstream
  API's own independently-tested GET-only enforcement
  (tests/test_api_safety.py::test_api_routes_are_get_only).
- Binds ONLY to an explicit interface IP you pass in (the VPS's Tailscale
  IP in normal use) — never 0.0.0.0, never the public interface. A socket
  bound to one address never accepts connections arriving on another;
  this is not a firewall rule, it is how the bind itself works.
- No systemd unit, no auto-start; this is a plain foreground/background
  process you start for a review session and kill afterward — see
  ops/preview/README.md for the exact commands.
- Does not modify, restart, or depend on any `qamc`-owned process, file,
  or credential. The reconstruction helpers below read only this `dev`
  checkout's own non-secret `config/settings.yaml` (cash_sweep section)
  and re-derive fields from data upstream's own read-only API already
  returned — never a direct DB/broker read.

Usage (from the `dev` account, this checkout):
    source .venv/bin/activate
    python ops/preview/branch_preview.py --host 100.111.170.97 --port 8810

Then from another tailnet device:
    http://ovh-vps.wallaby-bowfin.ts.net:8810/cockpit/
    http://ovh-vps.wallaby-bowfin.ts.net:8810/ui/

Stop: Ctrl-C in the foreground, or `kill <pid>` if backgrounded.
