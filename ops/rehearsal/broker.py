"""The one thing in a rehearsal that must not be real: the broker.

WHAT IS STUBBED, EXACTLY
------------------------
Not `AlpacaBroker`. The rehearsal uses the real `AlpacaBroker` class, with all
1,988 lines of its logic intact — tick-size quantization, the 20%-deviation
fat-finger guard, symbol normalization, the OrderStatus enum-value unwrap that
a 2026-05-27 audit found could mask a real rejection, the highest-stop
selection in `get_current_stop_price`, the post-fill (not OTO) protective-stop
placement that the 2026-07-16 audit rewrote. All of it runs.

What is replaced is one layer lower: the two alpaca-py SDK client objects the
broker holds, `self.client` (TradingClient) and `self._data_client`
(StockHistoricalDataClient). Those are the only two objects in `AlpacaBroker`
that put a request on the network. Swapping them is the narrowest possible cut
that still guarantees no order can reach the account, and it means the code
under test is the code that ships.

WHERE THE ANSWERS COME FROM
---------------------------
Reads are served from the rehearsal's own database copy — real production
data, not invented numbers:

  * positions      <- the `positions` table (broker-synced by every session)
  * equity history <- the `daily_pnl` table
  * prices         <- `positions.current_price` for held names

Anything with no evidence behind it returns the same "I don't know" a degraded
Alpaca returns: `None` price, `[]` bars, `{}` quote. The pipeline then takes
its real degradation path and records a real skip (`no_price`), which shows up
in the report. Nothing is fabricated to keep a rehearsal green.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT REPRESENT — READ BEFORE TRUSTING A RESULT
------------------------------------------------------------
The stub answers "would this session have produced these orders?". It cannot
answer "would those orders have worked?". Specifically it does NOT model:

  * **Fills.** With the default `fill_model="immediate"` a submitted order is
    reported filled, in full, at the price we asked for. Real fills partial,
    slip, queue behind other flow, or never happen. The 2026-08-19 incident —
    a funding sell that filled 36 seconds after the session gave up waiting —
    is invisible to this harness by construction. `fill_model="unfilled"`
    rehearses the opposite extreme.
  * **Broker-side rejection.** Buying power, PDT, fractionability, halted or
    non-shortable symbols, wash-trade blocks, minimum notional. Alpaca
    enforces these server-side; a rehearsal never asks it.
  * **Latency and ordering.** Every call returns instantly. Races between
    submission, cancellation and fill cannot occur here.
  * **Live prices.** Prices are the last close-of-session values production
    stored, not this morning's tape. A stop or limit computed against them is
    arithmetically real but temporally stale.
  * **Trading-day truth.** The exchange calendar is not consulted (that is a
    network call). The rehearsal asserts the date it was asked to rehearse is
    a trading day unless it falls on a weekend. Rehearsing a market holiday
    will therefore proceed where production would have stopped.

Every one of these appears in the rehearsal report under "what this rehearsal
could not tell you", so the limitation travels with the result.
