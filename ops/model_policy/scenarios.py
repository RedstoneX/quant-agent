"""Fixed benchmark scenarios for QAMC model selection.

Each scenario drives a REAL agent class (`src/agents/*`) with the REAL
system prompt (`config/prompts/*.md`) over a frozen, synthetic input, and
grades the result with deterministic Python assertions.

Why real agents rather than a standalone prompt harness: the thing we are
choosing a model for is not "can it write JSON" — it is "does it survive
`analyze_batch` / `decide` / `review`, including `parse_json()`'s candidate
scan, the per-entry isolation dropping malformed rows, and every Pydantic
validator in `src/models.py`". A model that scores well on a paraphrase of
the prompt but trips `_validate_rating_price_consistency` is not usable, and
only the real call path can tell us that.

Why synthetic (not recorded market) inputs: the grading has to be
deterministic and re-runnable by a reviewer months later, so every scenario
is constructed so that the *correct* answer is forced by arithmetic, not by
market opinion. `tech_uptrend` has an unambiguous uptrend; `risk_rr_breach`
contains a RANGE buy whose payoff is 0.42R and which is at the same time the
largest line in the plan at 18% of the book — two facts, and it is the pair
that the risk-manager prompt requires action on. **There is no universal
reward:risk floor to cite anywhere in this file any more** — the owner
retired it on 2026-09-11 (docs/WORK.md item 1(d)): a breakout carries no
reward:risk judgement at all, and a range trade's real ratio is a ranking
input and a starter-size cap, never a pass mark. Grading never asks "did the
model agree with me about the market" — only "did it apply the rule the
prompt states", which means the rule the prompt states TODAY.

ONE scenario is an exception to "synthetic", deliberately: `pm_selection`
replays a frozen, verbatim pull of a real production session
(`fixtures/run_64290730_pm_input.json`). Selection quality is the one thing
a constructed candidate set cannot measure — hand-built tiers with planted
traps test whether a model finds the author's pattern, not whether it reads
evidence. It stays deterministic and re-runnable for the same reason the
others do: the fixture is frozen on disk and the correct answer is forced by
the run's own recorded arithmetic, not by anyone's market opinion.

**2026-09-14, owner rule — what an exam may be built from.** Everything
above describes how these scenarios were first built. The owner has since
ruled that an exam may contain RAW FACTS ONLY, fetched fresh from the original
public source, with every derived value recomputed by today's code and no
agent output filled in from a recording or from invented text
(`ops/model_policy/fixture_policy.py`, docs/INCIDENT_HISTORY.md). Under that
rule most scenarios in this file cannot run: each now carries either a
`fixture` the policy checks or a `blocked_reason` naming exactly what is
missing, and `benchmark_models.py` refuses both before any paid call. The
runnable, rule-compliant exams are in the "External-source seat exams"
section near the end.

No secrets live here: scenarios are prices, tickers, public filings, and two
QUARANTINED paper-account recordings.

# 3c. portfolio_manager — SELECTION quality against a REAL opportunity set
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# WHAT THIS MEASURES: given the evidence a real morning actually produced,
# does the model choose the candidates the evidence supports?
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT MEASURE: profitability. Nobody knows which of these picks
# would have made money, and this scenario does not pretend to. Every check
# below is answerable from the run's own recorded numbers — the ratings,
# convictions, setup types and evidence the seats emitted — put through the
# desk's OWN CURRENT admission rules (`deterministic_selection.evaluate`,
# the shadow of production `candidate_eligibility`). A model that scores 1.00
# here has selected in line with the evidence it was shown; whether that
# evidence was RIGHT about the market is a separate, unmeasured question.
#
# **REBUILT 2026-09-14 (docs/WORK.md PM-gate item 8).** Every check here used
# to key off `analyst reward/risk >= 1.5`. That floor was retired on
# 2026-09-11 (item 1(d)) and this scenario went on grading against it, so it
# was scoring obedience to a deleted rule. The admitted set now comes from
# the desk's own current admission rules instead.
#
# **RE-POINTED 2026-09-14 (docs/WORK.md item 72, CLOSED).** The day this
# scenario first replayed, `run-64290730` (2026-09-01), carried no
# `computed_levels` on any of its 59 rows, so the structural reward:risk the
# live gate reads was None for every name. Measured on that file: the live
# `candidate_eligibility`, handed those real (all-None) ratios, admits 12
# names — this grader admitted 25, so 13 of its "admitted" names were ones
# production would refuse as unmeasurable. The earlier note here that "the
# admitted set does not depend on it" held only for the shadow in
# `deterministic_selection`, which reads the analyst's ratio. That file is
# kept only for three older audits (`LEVEL_LESS_SELECTION_FIXTURE`).
#
# WHY IT IS NOT SYNTHETIC. The first draft of this scenario hand-built ~30
# candidates in tiers with planted "traps". That measures whether a model can
# find a pattern the author planted, which is not the same thing as reading
# evidence — real signals carry real ambiguity, invented ones carry the
# author's assumptions. The fixture is therefore a verbatim pull of
# `run-bba4d4f3`, the 2026-09-02 13:31 UTC session, from the read-only
# Mission Control API: every analysis row is the API's `tech` payload for
# that symbol, in the order the run's own recorded prompt presented them;
# earnings are the API's per-symbol payloads; macro and news are those seats'
# recorded responses; account, positions, memory layers, evening insights and
# the BUY-eligibility universe are read out of the run's recorded
# portfolio_manager prompt. See the fixture's `_provenance` block, whose
# `fidelity` figures are measured, not asserted: rendered through today's
# `build_user_message`, 12 of 22 shared sections are byte-identical and all 64
# technical rows match the recorded prompt's rating, conviction, entry, stop
# and target. The rest differ because the renderer changed after the run, or
# because the section is computed live (PMFacts, portfolio heat, company
# profiles, proposal conversion) or would need SEC source URLs the payloads do
# not carry (smart-money findings — so AUGO, MAIR and RSG lose that one
# source in the registry here).
#
# THE DAY, measured. 91 candidates considered, 64 technical reads, 34
# actionable (14 breakout / 20 range), 10 of them bearish. **63 of the 64
# rows carry `computed_levels`** (the one without is MRVL, rated neutral), and
# `PortfolioConstructor.real_reward_risk_preview` returns a ratio for every
# one of the 34 actionable names. The live PM proposed nine targets — eight
# longs and an UNH short — and the risk seat approved them (category
# `rr_fail`, one allocation halved), yet the funnel recorded zero proposed
# orders, zero fills and `decision_state=no_proposal`. Why an approved plan
# produced no order is NOT established by this pull. Nothing below grades
# against the live output.
#
# WHAT "QUALIFIED" MEANS NOW, AND WHY IT IS NOT A NUMBER THIS FILE CHOOSES.
# The admitted set is whatever `deterministic_selection.evaluate` admits: the
# desk's own stated rules — current technical coverage, an actionable rating,
# BUY-eligibility for a long, a MEASURABLE payoff (its size no longer gates)
# or a dated catalyst row, and a net independent source score of at least 1
# so the §9.4 agreement ceiling leaves a rung to stand on. On this fixture it
# admits 25 of the 64 read names, exactly one of them a short (FLNC,
# sell/medium, net +1), and production `candidate_eligibility` handed the
# real structural ratios admits the IDENTICAL 25
# (tests/test_pm_selection_scenario.py pins that). The other nine bearish
# names, the live PM's UNH short among them, are refused by the net-evidence
# rule. Nothing here is tuned, and this file introduces no threshold of its
# own.
#
# WHY IT STILL SEPARATES EVIDENCE FROM FAMILIARITY. Nine bearish names the
# desk refuses, one it admits, and a live plan that shorted a refused one. What
# is NOT gradeable is famousness: of the five famous names with a read (AAPL,
# GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA, SPY), AAPL, MSFT and NVDA are ADMITTED by the desk's own
# rules, AAPL and NVDA on breakouts the prompt forbids judging on reward:risk
# at all. So `familiarity_bias` survives as a weight-0 DIAGNOSTIC — the share
# is reported on every run, and it scores nothing, because the desk has no
# rule against picking a well-evidenced mega-cap and the score must not invent
# one.
#
# THE CHECKS, and why they weigh what they weigh:
#   parsed_and_grounded          0.10  survived the grounding validator
#   opens_a_position             0.10  did anything at all
#   selection_from_eligible_set  0.25  every pick is one the desk admits
#   takes_an_eligible_short      0.25  took one of the two admitted shorts
#   familiarity_bias             0.00  DIAGNOSTIC ONLY, reported not scored
# The two 0.25s are the measurement; the two 0.10s are a guard around it.
# **The surviving shares are deliberately NOT rescaled to sum to 1.0.**
# `benchmark_models._run_scenario` divides by the actual total weight, so the
# four scoring checks keep exactly the proportions they had; rescaling them
# would mean typing four new weights, which is precisely the invented number
# this rewrite exists to remove. A model that opens nothing therefore scores
# 0.10/0.70 — below any book of real picks — because the two selection checks
# are gated on having made a pick. Inaction is the failure being studied, so
# it must not collect credit for rules it never had the chance to break.
#
# TWO CHECKS WERE DELETED RATHER THAN RESTATED, because neither could be
# stated honestly against the desk that exists:
#   * `rr_floor_discipline` (was 0.15) graded "every sub-floor pick names a
#     catalyst". The live rule (`PortfolioManagerAgent._apply_subfloor_
#     catalyst_rule`) requires a catalyst ONLY when a range trade's real
#     payoff is UNMEASURABLE; a thin-but-measurable one is kept, uncited, and
#     capped at starter size. There is no longer any rule that a sub-floor
#     pick must cite anything, so there is nothing left to grade.
#   * `selection_from_qualified_set`'s old majority-of-picks-clear-1.5 bar is
#     gone with the floor. Its replacement above is a different check with
#     the same weight, not a renamed one: it asks whether the desk would have
#     ADMITTED each pick, which is a rule, not a ratio.

# 4b. risk_manager — the two rules the 2026-08-13 audit gave it the evidence
#     for. Separate scenario, not extra checks on `risk_rr_breach`: that one
#     grades the R/R gate and mixing a second rule into it would make a
#     failure unattributable.
#
#     Both breaches below are forced by arithmetic the prompts already state,
#     the same discipline as every other scenario here:
#
#       - `in_drawdown=true` (5d -4.6% is past the -3% trigger) requires PM
#         to halve every new BUY. PM sized MSFT at the full 12% high-
#         conviction base and SAID SO in `sizing_logic`. Nothing
#         deterministic enforces this rule, so RM is the only check on it.
#       - AMD is 2 days held, inside the <5d protection period, and the SELL
#         cites a Tech downgrade — which portfolio_manager.md names
#         explicitly as NOT sufficient.

# Two positions with opposite, unambiguous dispositions:
#   AMD  — thesis broken. Deep loss, 0.4% above a stop that sits 0.25 ATRs
#          away (well inside daily noise, which the prompt calls out), no
#          progress toward target in 21 days. Leaving this untouched means
#          the broker stop fires on the next tick of noise.
#   NVDA — thesis working. Ahead of pace, comfortably above its stop.
#          Selling it is the classic cut-the-winner error the prompt warns
#          against, so a SELL/REDUCE here is graded as a miss.
