"""Stage 3 (shorts) — `pending_protection_restores` gains a `side` column.

Before this fix the write-ahead table used to restore protective stops
after a crash carried no side column: `_derive_close_side_for_drain`
correctly refused to guess when the broker couldn't be read, but every
drain path then fell through to a `side: str = "sell"` default — a
comment at the call sites said this was fine BECAUSE shorts could not be
opened yet. Stage 3 makes that premise false.

This file proves:
  1. A row written today (via `insert_pending_protection_restore`) persists
     its real side and `get_pending_protection_restores` returns it.
  2. The drain path (`_resolve_wal_row_side`, used by both branches of
     `_drain_pending_protection_restores`) PREFERS the persisted side over
     any live-broker derivation — even when the broker would say something
     else, proving it isn't silently re-deriving it.
  3. A legacy row with `side IS NULL` (written before this migration) still
     uses the OLD broker-derived fallback, unchanged — and logs that it did.
