"""Board item 218: a BUY written by a full morning session carries the
constructor's MEASURED `structural_ceiling` into the `trades` row.

The guard in `test_buy_insert_evidence_guard.py` proves the insert site PASSES
the kwarg and the ledger test proves the ledger STORES it. Neither proves the
value survives every hop between them (constructor -> PM stage -> risk stage
-> execution -> insert). This drives the real stages end to end on the
rehearsal broker and reads the row back from the real database.

`stop_basis` is deliberately NOT asserted non-null: the constructor ships
`stop_rule=None` for a stop with no level behind it, and recording a
substitute there would be a fabricated audit value.
