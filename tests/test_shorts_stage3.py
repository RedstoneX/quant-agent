"""Stage 3 of short selling — shorts can be OPENED and COVERED.

Stage 1 (`tests/test_shorts_countable.py`) made a held short COUNTABLE.
Stage 2 (`tests/test_shorts_safe.py`) made its protective-stop geometry
correct. This stage lifts the last gate: the order path itself can now open
and cover a short, subject to three things that gate it — a borrow check
(D6), two exposure caps (D9), and a mandatory protective stop that escalates
to an immediate market cover on failure (D7) — and none of them is a master
switch (D11); together they ARE the control surface.

Surfaces covered: ``src/portfolio_constructor.py`` (signed targets, sign-
crossing refusal, direction-aware stop geometry/widening, the sizing
haircut, ``_build_short``/``_build_cover``), ``src/risk/rules.py`` (the two
short exposure caps, the cover-cash exemption), and
``src/pipeline_stages.py``'s ``ExecutionStage`` (the borrow gate, side-aware
order submission, and the protection-failure escalation).

    two sources (`target.suggested_stop_price`, `analysis.stop_loss`) ->
    `TechAnalysisResult`'s own validator (`src/models.py`), which already
    guarantees a BUY's `stop_loss` sits below ITS OWN `entry_price` at
    ingestion — so the analyst never emits a self-contradictory pair.

    Measured against a real production database snapshot
    (sandbox copy of live `quant_agent.db`, 2026-08 window): the live quote
    `PortfolioConstructor` prices a NEW target off (`price_map`, filled by
    `pipeline_stages.py` from a fresh broker call AFTER macro/news/earnings/
    portfolio_manager have all already run) lands 11-108 seconds and up to
    8.3% away from the price the technical analyst's `entry_price`/
    `stop_loss` pair was computed against — real, measured drift, not a
    hypothetical. One production case (DIS) drifted -1.8% in 108s against a
    stop set only 2.2% from the analyst's entry, landing $0.48 from
    flipping outright.

    This is the mechanism: nothing is broken on either side (the analyst's
    numbers are self-consistent; the live quote is a real, fresh price) —
    the analyst's structural stop is simply a real price LEVEL, and by the
    time the constructor prices the trade off a live quote fetched later in
    the same run, ordinary price movement can have already carried the
    market through that level. Buying (or shorting) through an already-
    breached level is not a data-quality bug to fix upstream, and there is
    no sign-flip, unit-conversion or rounding defect anywhere in the traced
    chain (`_resolve_stop` -> `_widen_stop_past_noise` ->
    `_resolve_entry_and_stop`'s side check) — the refusal below IS the
    correct, working backstop for exactly this case, and this test locks
    in that the live-quote path (not just the synthetic
    `suggested_stop_price` path `test_short_stop_at_or_below_entry_is_

#    SELL-to-open entry order untouched — a fill on it would re-open the
#    exact short exposure the emergency close just cleared. The mechanism
#    itself (order-type-based filtering in AlpacaBroker.cancel_open_entry_
#    orders) is unit-tested in tests/test_broker.py; these two prove the
