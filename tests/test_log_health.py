"""The log-health report, tested against REAL production log lines.

`tests/fixtures/log_health_production_excerpt.txt` is copied verbatim out of
/home/qamc/quant-agent/quant_agent.log and its rotations (2026-09-18). Nothing
in it is invented, because a classifier tested against lines someone wrote to
make the classifier pass proves only that the author can write two matching
regular expressions. The fixture is the interface; if the desk changes the
wording of a message, this file is where that shows up.

What is covered here:
  - every reportable family fires against its genuine line, and no genuine
    line goes unclassified except the one deliberately left as proof that the
    fail-closed bucket works;
  - the severity rule — a correct refusal and a handled data drop produce NO
    bullet, while a naked position always does;
  - the "nothing is wrong" short form;
  - the watermark: two consecutive reports neither skip a line nor count one
    twice;
  - the only length ceiling is Telegram's own, and hitting it splits the
    message instead of dropping a finding.

# --- 2026-09-19: the technical seat's own failures, previously invisible ---
#
# The audit that forced this: `classify()` returned None on six real (or
# realistic, same wording as the source) technical-seat lines, because the
# matching was case-sensitive and several of the seat's own log lines had
# never been given a pattern at all. The technical seat is now the ONLY seat
# that can stop the desk (owner ruling, 2026-09-18), so a line naming one of
# its failures must never fall through unclassified.
#
# The first four are copied verbatim into the fixture (see the "Technical
# seat, added 2026-09-19" section) from quant_agent.log.3 / .log.4. The last
# two — the whole-answer non-JSON case and the request-sizing fallback —
# have never fired in the retained production history, so they are built
# here from the exact format string the source uses
# (`src/agents/tech_analyst.py`), the same way the rest of this module
# already builds records for lines the fixture cannot supply (see
# `test_an_owner_alert_is_not_counted_twice` above).
