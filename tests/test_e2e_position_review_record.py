"""End-to-end: the close position review's DURABLE record, hermetic.

`test_e2e_close_existing_book.py` proves what `run_close` DOES to the book
(stop moved, sold, left alone). This file proves what it LEAVES BEHIND, and
that the thing left behind is the thing later surfaces read — this desk
has shipped recorders that ran perfectly and reached no human.

Through the same harness (`_run_close`), from the same recorded inputs:

- the `session_reports` row for ('close', today) exists, is read back
  through the read-only replay reader, and carries the SAME money-visible
  payload the run returned: status, coverage gaps, orders, run id, and the
  reviewer's per-position decision WITH its reason;
- the replay renderer turns that stored row into the owner's message and
  the message names the symbol and the decision taken on it;
- a reviewer SELL that survived substantiation and the risk seat lands in
  the `trades` ledger with its reason, under this run's id, as a fill —
  the row the dashboard's history and the next review's "own recent
  decisions" both read;
- the per-position review metrics snapshot for the next session was
  written for the held symbol under this run's id.

Numbers come from the close file's constants (seeded trade and fixture
bars); nothing here is picked. No network, no broker, no live provider,
no production database: `tmp_path/desk.db` is the whole world.
