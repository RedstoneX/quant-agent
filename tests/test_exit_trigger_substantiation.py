"""Two live defects in how exits are justified and judged (2026-09-18).

Defect 1 — the exit gate rewarded reciting a phrase. On 2026-09-16 the two
real exits (COP SELL, EQNR REDUCE, run `midday-d8996a51`) carried the
reason ``"adverse news"``, verbatim and in their entirety. They passed the
substring gate because the phrase is on the list, and
`holding_discipline_claim_check` returned "ok" because it read the prose
for a claim it knew how to check and those two words made none. A seat
that phrased an exit as an unverifiable external event always got its way;
one that honestly described a stall got audited by the metric veto.

Defect 2 — `distance_to_stop_pct = (current - stop) / current * 100` is in
`_HIGHER_IS_BETTER`, so WIDENING the stop makes a position look improved.
Real recorded snapshots, 2026-08-31 close -> 2026-09-01 midday: V 1.42 ->
3.41 "improved" while r_multiple fell -0.11 -> -0.82; CMCSA 3.53 -> 5.58
while r fell -0.04 -> -0.33; DIS 1.85 -> 5.07 while progress fell -3.06 ->
-12.50.

Kept to the minimum that pins the structured trigger and the closed
loophole.
