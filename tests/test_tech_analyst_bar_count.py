"""The technical seat must be told the bar window the code actually sends.

THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES (board item 98). `config/prompts/tech_analyst.md` told
the model "only the last 20 bars are attached here", leaned on "the 20 bars"
for pivots and gap detection, and named "the 20 bars you are shown" when
explaining why structural levels come from elsewhere — while
`_BARS_PER_SYMBOL` had been 40 and the slice had been sending 40. The
technical analyst is the ONLY seat allowed to halt the desk, so a seat
mis-briefed about its own inputs is the worst place in the system for this
class of drift. Two prior prompt-drift PRs (#464, #467) both shipped without
touching it, which is why this file exists: the fix is not a wording change,
it is a mechanical coupling plus a check that the coupling still holds.

WHY THESE CHECKS AND NOT AN ASSERTION ON "40". Asserting the sheet says 40
would pass today and rot the moment `_BARS_PER_SYMBOL` moves — the same shape
of defect, one number later. So nothing here names a bar count except the
data-sufficiency floor it reads back out of the sheet.

WHAT THE FIRST DRAFT OF THIS FILE MISSED, found by adversary review before it
shipped, and why each check below is shaped the way it is:

  * A placeholder written `{{ tech.bars_per_symbol }}` with spaces stopped
    substituting and every test still passed — literal template syntax would
    have shipped to the seat. The renderer is now a regex, and
    `test_rendered_prompt_leaves_no_template_syntax` scans for ANY surviving
    braces rather than for the one exact spelling.
  * Changing the slice to `bars[:_BARS_PER_SYMBOL]` — the OLDEST 40 bars, with
    the sheet still saying "most recent" — passed the AST check, because that
    check only asked whether the constant appeared in some slice somewhere.
    `test_user_message_sends_the_most_recent_window` now builds a real user
    message and reads which bars came out, which is a behaviour check and not
    a syntax one.
  * `docs/OUTCOME.md` records that NEITHER confirmed prompt-drift defect ever
    lived in a prompt FILE — both were Python-assembled strings. A file scanner
    would have caught neither, so `test_user_message_states_no_bar_count` scans
    the assembled user message too.
  * The regex missed every reworded form ("40-bar window", "forty bars", "40
    sessions", "40 trading days", "40 daily candles"). All are matched now,
    spelled-out numbers included.

THE ONE EXEMPT "20". The sheet's "< 20 bars of history" is a data-sufficiency
rule — the minimum history below which the seat must return `neutral` — not a
claim about what was attached. The board item says to leave it alone. It is NOT
independent of the window, though: the seat can only count bars it was given,
so the rule is meaningful only while the window is at least that large. That is
now asserted rather than assumed.
