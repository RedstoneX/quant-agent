"""The `pm_selection` grader must actually discriminate.

`ops/` is not collected by pytest, so a grading bug there fails silently
until the next sweep — which costs real money and is exactly when the
harness has to work (same reasoning as
tests/test_model_policy_harness_imports.py, which caught that once already).

These tests never call a model. They drive `_pm_selection_grade` with
hand-built `PortfolioDecision` objects and assert that the score separates
the behaviours the scenario exists to tell apart:

  1. selection from the admitted set, including a short  -> 1.00
  2. selection of names the desk deterministically
     refuses                                             -> the selection
                                                            check fails
  3. selection on famous names                           -> REPORTED as a
                                                            number, never
                                                            scored
  4. doing nothing at all                                -> the live desk's
                                                            own failure,
                                                            graded as failure

**REBUILT 2026-09-14 (docs/WORK.md PM-gate item 8).** Every assertion here
used to be written against `analyst reward/risk >= 1.5`. The owner retired
that floor on 2026-09-11 (item 1(d)) and this grader kept scoring against it,
so a model comparison run on it would have paid to discover which model best
obeys a deleted rule. The admitted set now comes from
`deterministic_selection.evaluate` — the desk's own current admission rules.

**RE-POINTED 2026-09-14 (docs/WORK.md item 72).** The fixture is now
production run-bba4d4f3 (2026-09-02), because the previous day carried no
computed levels and the live gate could not measure payoff on any name. The
facts asserted below (64 reads, 63 with levels, 34 actionable and all 34 with
a structural ratio, 14 breakouts, 25 admitted, 1 admitted short) are that
run's real numbers put through the desk's rules, not chosen by the test.
