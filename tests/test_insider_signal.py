"""Routine/opportunistic Form 4 classification.

Evidence basis is ``docs/RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md`` section 1. The tests below
pin the rules that document actually supports — including the two places it
contradicts the folk version of this filter: a 10b5-1 flag is not a noise
marker, and trade size relative to the insider's own holding is *reported*
rather than turned into a cutoff, because the source behind it (Scott & Xu,
FAJ 2004) measures the small-fraction band as significantly positive rather
than as noise. See that module's docstring, departure #3.

    Note on scope: a row with ``transaction_value_usd is None`` can never
    reach ``SECForm4Provider.fetch()``'s returned observations at all —
    the survivors loop (both the individual-materiality and the cluster
    path) requires ``transaction_value_usd is not None`` before a row is
    even added to the candidate window, so a value-unknown row is dropped

    inherited unchanged from `b1944cd` (pre-dates this branch and
    routine/opportunistic classification entirely), not something this
    classifier introduced or can fail-closed around — you cannot assess
    dollar materiality for a transaction of unknown dollar value. It is
    flagged in the PR description as a separate, pre-existing gap rather
    than fixed here. What this test pins is the part that *is* this
    classifier's contract: at the classification layer itself, missing
    amounts produce ``indeterminate``, never ``routine`` — so nothing
    silently zeroes this row's weight or reason before the materiality gate
    even gets a chance to run.
