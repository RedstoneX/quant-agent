"""The take-profit is COMPUTED, not guessed (2026-09-01).

Reward:risk is `(target - entry) / (entry - stop)`. The stop has been derived
from measured volatility since 2026-08-27; the target was still the language
model's `reference_target`, so the gate divided a measurement by an opinion.
On the morning run of 2026-09-01 (`run-64290730`) that arithmetic put 30 of 38
actionable signals (79%) under the 1.5 floor before any judgement was applied,
including the two highest-conviction calls of the day, and the desk placed no
trades.

The floor is not the defect and is not touched here. These tests pin its
numerator: derived from the same bars the stop comes from, working in both
directions, and refusing BY NAME rather than falling back to a fabricated
default — a manufactured target with better provenance is still manufactured.
