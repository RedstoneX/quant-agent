"""Hermetic ROTATION: the desk sells a held name to fund a new one, same session.

Same harness as tests/test_e2e_morning_session.py (read it first) and the
close-session file tests/test_e2e_close_existing_book.py, whose book-seeding
and expectations-from-inputs style this follows. `run_morning()` runs on a
book that ALREADY holds one long with its protective stop resting, and
almost no cash, so a new buy can only be paid for with the held name's
sale proceeds. The portfolio-manager seat (scripted) asks for the new name
at a target weight and closes the held name (weight 0); everything after
the wire is production: constructor, risk engine, Risk Manager, execution.

Doctrine asserted (never read back from the run):
  * the held name is sold WHOLE, and its resting stop is cleared first;
  * the sale comes before the buy (the proceeds fund it);
  * the buy costs more than the cash the account started with, and no more
    than cash plus the sale proceeds;
  * the buy is sized by the target weight of the portfolio, whole shares;
  * exactly ONE GTC SELL stop rests against the new name, whole size, below
    its entry, and none rests against the sold name;
  * no gap in broker-truth stop coverage, and no socket left the box.

NOT COVERED: the desk's AUTOMATIC below-bar rotation tier (the PM asks for
this rotation; the desk's own culling is not driven); partial fills;
shorts; a refused buy leg; anything a model seat says beyond this script.
