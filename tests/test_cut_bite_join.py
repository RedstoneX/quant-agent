"""The cut-bite observation is assembled from two points in time, by run id.

Three of the four fields a cut-bite ledger row asks for are known where the
cut happens; the seat's verdict is formed later in the same session. These
tests pin that the cut-site record is DURABLY written, that the verdict joins
to it on `run_id`, that a run with no verdict yields NO observation rather
than a three-of-four one, and that none of the recording changes the prompt
text the seat actually reads.

Everything here runs against a real sqlite connection carrying the real
schema, so a green test means the value was written and read back, not that a
column name happened to match a guard's word list.
