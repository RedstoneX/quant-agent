"""The two things about a revisable take-profit that must never regress.

1. A REVISION CANNOT SWITCH OFF THE EXIT GUARD'S VETO.

   The target is the DENOMINATOR of `thesis_progress_pct`, and `pace` is
   progress over elapsed horizon. Both are in
   `src.risk.exit_guard._HIGHER_IS_BETTER`, and
   `veto_contradicted_exit` only blocks a deterioration claim while
   `MetricDeltas.net_improved` holds — i.e. something improved and NOTHING
   measurably worsened.

   So raising a target mechanically lowers progress and lowers pace, which
   lands both in `worsened`, which clears `net_improved`, which lets a
   "this position is stalling" SELL through that was previously blocked. A
   revisable target built without fixing the measurement side is a machine
   for making winners look stalled and then selling them.

   The fix chosen is to measure progress and pace against the PINNED entry
   target (`trades.initial_take_profit`) rather than the live one. These
   tests pin it end to end: the arithmetic, and the guard's actual verdict.

2. NOTHING AUTOMATICALLY EXITS AT THE TARGET, and the revision path did not
   change that. The automatic trim was deleted in PR #321;
   `tests/test_pipeline.py::test_no_fixed_gain_automatic_profit_trim_exists`
   pins the general rule, and the checks here pin it specifically for the
   revision module and for the flag schema.
