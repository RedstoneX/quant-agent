"""A FAILED price read is never "no price".

Owner ruling 2026-10-08: "if price can't be read, that's a fundamental
absolute deal breaker". The broker read is retried; when it still fails it
raises `PriceReadFailed`. On the entry path the failure is classified by one
read of the session's reference symbol: reference reads -> that one name is
refused (`price_read_failed`), others trade; reference fails too -> the feed
is down, no new entries for the rest of the session (`price_feed_unreadable`),
recorded durably. Absence stays a per-name `no_sizing_print`. Existing stops
are never touched by any of this.

Owner ruling, same day: "this is a swing trading desk, not scalping. The desk
can keep re-asking until a price is received. It should not be hammered
because that will get us banned." A name with no today print YET waits; ONE
batched request per ask covers every waiting name, on a rising backoff, until
it prints (then it is sized through the normal entry path) or the pass's own
slot ends (then it is skipped under `no_print_by_window_end`). The ask count
is bounded by the slot and logged.
