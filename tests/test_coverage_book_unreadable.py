"""The stop-coverage sweep must never report all-clear when it could not
read the book.

`TradingPipeline._reconcile_stop_coverage` returns `list[dict]` and every
caller reads `[]` as "no gaps — every position is covered". Its first act
used to be a bare `get_positions()` whose `except` returned `[]`, so a
broker read failure turned the desk's only naked-position audit into a
clean bill of health in the morning, evening, position-review and
intraday sessions at once.

Owner ruling 2026-10-02: retry, ask a different way, then ACT — a
duplicate stop the broker refuses costs less than a naked position left
alone. These tests pin the escalation and pin that a SUCCESSFUL read is
untouched, fractional classification included.
