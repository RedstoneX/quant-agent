"""item 181: a SHORT's RISK-BUDGET divisor must be the today print, never a
stale higher analyst entry.

docs/WORK.md item 181. `sizing_price` in the submit loop is
`max(today_print, approved_entry)` — deliberately conservative on the
ALLOCATION path in both directions (a higher divisor means fewer shares,
either less capital on a buy or a smaller short). But the RISK-BUDGET path
divides `budget / abs(sizing_price - stop)`, and for a SHORT
(`risk_per_share = stop - price`) a HIGHER price NARROWS that spread. When
the analyst's `entry` sits above today's `print`, using the entry for the
risk-budget divisor understates `risk_per_share` and INFLATES `qty_by_risk`,
letting the short exceed its ratified risk budget by roughly
`(stop - print) / (stop - entry)`. It is bounded by the allocation-path
`min()` cap, so it is not unbounded, but it is a real, untested overshoot on
the risk-budget path specifically.

This test drives the REAL `ExecutionStage` submit loop (same harness
pattern as `tests/test_item_120_buy_price_sizing.py`), spies on
`_qty_by_risk_budget` to capture the `sizing_price` it is actually called
with, and shows that a SHORT with `entry_price` above the today print must
be risk-sized off the print — not the entry.
