"""Board item 109 — the macro double-count, and the owner's 2026-09-25 ruling.

Macro is the only seat that back-fills a stance onto EVERY name: when a read
states nothing about a symbol's sector, `build_evidence_registry` writes the
market-wide `equity_outlook` into that symbol's slot. The §9.4 agreement
tally then counted it as one more INDEPENDENT per-name seat, so one market
opinion was counted once per name, as though several analysts had each looked
at each name.

The ruling this file pins, in three parts:

  * Macro STAYS as a per-name input, weighted by the strength the reading
    itself states. The seat's only strength expression is `confidence`, which
    `MacroAnalysis.to_verdict` already reports as `conviction` and
    `src/verdicts.py::score_verdict` already weights; magnitude stays
    `NO_STATED_STRENGTH`, because a second scale keyed on the same field is
    the double count retired item 31 deleted. Nothing new is invented here.
  * The weighting is SIGN-SYMMETRIC — the same reading at the same stated
    strength moves a long and a short by the same magnitude in opposite
    directions, with no asymmetry between the two sides.
  * No single seat, macro included, may admit a name on its own.
