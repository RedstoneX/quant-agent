"""The circuit's per-call attempt ceiling must cover the retry loop's worst case.

THE INCIDENT THIS FILE EXISTS FOR (2026-08-31)
----------------------------------------------
`BaseAgent.run()` takes up to `_max_retries()` attempts at an agent's primary
model and then, if the primary is not itself Anthropic and a fallback key is
configured, ONE cross-provider failover. Worst case: three provider attempts.

`llm_cost_circuit.max_provider_attempts_per_call` was pinned by hand at two.

So every failover attempt was attempt three against a ceiling of two, and the
circuit stopped it. Not sometimes — always, and only in the case failover
exists to handle: a retryable primary failure (429/5xx/timeout) burns both
permitted attempts before failover is even reached. Cross-provider failover
could never once complete. On Monday 2026-08-31 an upstream rate-limit on the
primary triggered it at 09:32 ET, two minutes after the open, and because
`provider_attempt_limit` was also the one trip code wired to the durable
operator-reset latch, paid analysis stayed off for the rest of the day over
$0.05 of a $2.75 budget.

The two numbers lived in different worlds — an env-overridable module
constant in `src/agents/base.py`, a YAML setting read by `src/cost_circuit.py`
— which is how they drifted apart for six days across five separate circuit
trips without anyone noticing. These tests bind them together so they cannot
drift again silently.

# one of those tests passed throughout the six days this defect was live. They
# could not have caught it: `tests/conftest.py` sets
# `BaseAgent._allow_unmetered_for_tests = True` for the whole suite, so those
# agents run with NO cost circuit attached at all. And `test_cost_circuit.py`
# exercises the circuit with no failover.
#
# So the suite proved failover works without the circuit, and the circuit
# works without failover, and nothing anywhere ran the two together — which is
# precisely where they contradicted each other. These tests attach a real
# breaker to a real agent and make the primary fail for real reasons.

# ------------------------------------- charging for calls that cost nothing

# Defect 7 (2026-08-31). A logical call can attempt several DIFFERENT
# providers, and `run()` re-raises the PRIMARY error while discarding whatever
# the failover hit. `fail_call` judged "did this cost anything" from that one
# exception, so a failover rejected 401 — which by definition billed nothing —
# was invisible, and the whole call was charged its conservative reserve at
# the FAILOVER model's dearer price.
#
# Live on the desk that afternoon: two upstream refusals plus a missing
# credential, real cost $0, charged $0.62, and the unexplained spend then
# latched everything. The rate limit did not stop trading. The phantom bill
# for it did.
