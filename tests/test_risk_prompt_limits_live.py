"""The Risk Manager is SHOWN its limits, never TOLD them.

Two jobs in this file.

1. THE BUILD CHECK (`test_no_hand_typed_limit_beside_a_risk_setting`,
   `test_every_wired_setting_still_has_a_placeholder`,
   `test_every_placeholder_in_the_sheet_resolves`). These fail CI when a
   numeric limit is hand-typed into `config/prompts/risk_manager.md` instead
   of being rendered from `config/settings.yaml`.

2. THE BEHAVIOUR (the rest). Each wired limit renders its live value; moving
   the setting moves what the reviewer reads; a placeholder naming no setting
   fails loudly rather than rendering blank or a stale default.

WHY THIS EXISTS — AND WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED, WHICH IS NOT DRIFT. Commit
e1c639a2 (2026-09-11, PR #297, "single-name cap 100 -> 33") set
`risk.max_position_pct: 65` and, in the SAME diff about a hundred lines away,
wrote "tighter than the 33% long single-name ceiling" into this sheet. The
prompt was wrong at birth, not stale over time — the commit's title says 33,
it landed at 65, and only one of the two hunks got the correction. The same
commit ALSO wrote `max_position_pct=65` correctly into the sheet's hard-rule
inventory, so the sheet contradicted itself from the first minute.

Worse, and the reason this file's check has the shape it does: the line that
commit REPLACED read "`max_single_short_pct` (10%, half the long single-name
ceiling". That is a RELATION. It carries no second copy of any number and
could not drift. The commit swapped a drift-immune phrasing for a hand-typed
literal.

TWO CHECKS, BECAUSE ONE OF THEM WOULD HAVE MISSED THE ORIGINATING BUG.

  (a) `_hand_typed_limits` — adjacency. A digit stated as the value of a
      `RiskConfig` field name (within ADJACENCY_CHARS of it) must be a
      rendered placeholder. Catches `max_position_pct=65` and
      "`max_single_short_pct` (10%".

  (b) `_unrendered_limit_phrases` — the limit-noun pattern. A numeral read as
      the value of a "ceiling / cap / budget / limit / floor / maximum"
      phrase must be a rendered placeholder. This is the one that catches the
      2026-09-11 shape, where the literal ("33% long single-name ceiling")
      sits well past the adjacency window of any setting name — and check (a)
      demonstrably does NOT catch it. See
      `test_adjacency_alone_would_have_missed_the_originating_bug`, which
      pins that gap so nobody re-describes (a) as sufficient.

WHY BOTH ARE DELIBERATELY NARROW. A general "no numbers in the prompt" rule
would cry wolf constantly — the sheet is full of legitimate figures: worked
arithmetic ("a 15% position stopped 3% below entry risks 0.45% of equity"),
break-even hit rates, prices in a `reason` example, dates, spec section
numbers. Both checks therefore key on a limit being STATED AS SUCH, which an
illustration does not do.

WHAT NEITHER CHECK CATCHES, stated plainly rather than papered over:

  * a limit restated with no setting name nearby AND no limit noun — "no
    single holding may exceed 33% of the book" passes both. Only the
    placeholder-coverage check (c) constrains this, and only by ensuring the
    correct rendered statement still exists somewhere.
  * a number that is a limit elsewhere in the codebase but is not a
    `RiskConfig` field. The 50% correlation-cluster advisory is a function
    default in `src/risk/rules.py`, not a setting, and is invisible here.
  * a placeholder rendering the WRONG setting for the sentence it sits in.
    Nothing mechanical can know that a sentence about shorts should cite the
    short cap.

So: these checks make the 2026-09-11 shape fail the build. They do not make
this class of defect impossible, and this file must not be cited as if they
did.

# for `allow_margin` (Codex r11 P2, see the comment at that argument).

# WHY THIS IS A BEHAVIOURAL CHECK AND NOT A SOURCE SCAN. The first version of
# these tests regex-scanned `src/pipeline.py` for `^\s*([a-z_]+)=` inside the
# `RiskConfig(` call, which proved only that a KEYWORD NAME was typed there.
# a limit hard-coded at its current value would have satisfied it — the very
# defect the test claims to exclude. So instead: move the setting, rebuild the
# enforcing object through the pipeline's OWN builder, and see whether the
# object moved with it.

    """The other half of item 62's justification, corrected 2026-09-14.

    Losing a seat used to drop the name a rung on the graduated agreement
    ceiling. That ladder is retired: the net is now a go/no-go, so every
    positive net sizes identically and only a net at or below zero stops the
    trade. Asserted here, in the file that carries item 62's reasoning, so
    the reasoning cannot keep resting on a mechanism that no longer exists.
