"""The P&L figure must reach the message whenever the account was read —
and the sentence that replaces it must be TRUE when it did not.

Owner, 2026-09-23, verbatim: "why can't I see the P&L?" That morning's
message said:

    📈 Today's P&L: not available
    📊 Total P&L: not available
       This message was built without an account read, so there is no figure
       yet.

and then, four lines lower, printed the book it had just read. Two separate
defects in one block:

  1. The morning trading session held the account snapshot and simply never
     put the P&L keys on its result — only the position-review and
     intra-check happy paths did. Every other exit (no_trades,
     pm_agent_failure, paid_analysis_suspended, executed) dropped them.
  2. The explanation was asserted from the ABSENCE of those keys, so it
     claimed a cause it could not know. An explanation the code cannot
     prove is itself a defect (owner, standing).

These tests pin both: the figure travels with the account read, and the
sentence follows from the recorded reason, never from a guess.
