"""The trend exit fires on a confirmed swing break, not a 3.0 ATR give-back.

Decided 2026-10-09: the exit is kept (it can fire before the 3.0 ATR
Chandelier trail), but its unmeasured give-back trigger is replaced by
structure. A long's trend is broken when price closes below the last
confirmed higher low, or when a lower swing low is confirmed; a short
mirrors both. Swings are the trailing stop's own (`_swing_lows` /
`_swing_highs`, `PIVOT_WINDOW` = 3 bars each side). Every test here fails on
main, where `check_alignment_exit` takes no `bars`.
