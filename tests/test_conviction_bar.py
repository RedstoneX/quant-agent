"""The 2026-09-25 owner ROLE-BASED conviction bar: earn the right to ENTER and STAY.

Mandate (verbatim intent):
  * The TECHNICAL (chart) seat is a TIMING VETO, not a weighted yes-vote. A
    broken/hostile chart blocks ENTRY even when the fundamental thesis is
    strong ("right name, wrong time"). Technical adds no positive weight; it
    only GATES.
  * The own-bar clears only when at least one NON-technical seat took a
    SUPPORTED DIRECTIONAL side (a real directional call backed by evidence and
    an invalidation, not a bare neutral shrug) AND no seat is opposed. This is
    NOT a genuine specificity/falsifiability test — News and Smart-money
    always synthesise their invalidation, so it cannot distinguish a templated
    reason from an analyst-authored one.
  * ONE bar, TWO verdicts (owner ruling 2026-09-25). ENTRY
    (`candidate_eligibility` R7) is full-strict: any failure refuses the buy.
    The STAY side is OPPOSITION-ONLY: a currently-HELD name is culled (into the
    same `blocked` set, via rotation's `ineligible_hold` tier) ONLY when a seat
    turns ACTIVELY OPPOSED to the held direction. A held name that merely fails
    the entry bar on SOFT grounds (no technical read, neutral/non-confirming
    technical, or support faded to neutral) is dropped from the fresh-entry
    ranking but NOT culled — it earns its right to stay. There is no
    confirmation counter; deterioration is handled by the separate
    price-thesis-break exit (`src.risk.exit_guard`).
