"""The hermetic CLOSE session on a FULL, LEVERED book that the ladder says
must shrink — judged on what the desk sells, how much, and what protection
is left standing.

tests/test_e2e_morning_session.py drives a morning on an empty book;
tests/test_e2e_morning_protection.py judges the buy it makes. This file
drives `TradingPipeline(config).run_close()` on a book that is ALREADY
over its gross-exposure ceiling once the de-levering ladder
(`src/risk/rules.py::resolve_gross_ceiling`, owner-ratified 2026-09-01)
is read off the account's own drawdown — the same production objects,
the same seat seam, the same rehearsal broker stand-in and the same
socket-level network wall.

The reviewer seat says HOLD on every name, so nothing a model says can
reduce the book: what is sold is decided by the INPUTS, and every
expectation below is derived from those inputs, never read back from the
run:

  the ladder   the equity curve carries a prior high of PEAK_EQUITY and
               today's equity is E, so the drawdown is (E/PEAK - 1): in
               the -15% to -20% band the ceiling is 1.0x, and the book's
               gross of 1.41x equity is over it by exactly OVER dollars;
  the cut      biggest-loser-first (the ratified ordering with no fresh
               seat read): the one name with negative unrealised P&L is
               sold, for the whole-share quantity that clears OVER, and
               no other name is touched;
  exposure     gross exposure after the sale is at or under the ceiling —
               and never above it again at any later point in the session;
  protection   the sold name's resting stop is cleared before the sale
               and exactly one new GTC stop rests behind the residual, at
               the cleared stop's level; every untouched name keeps
               exactly the one stop it started with; the broker-truth
               coverage audit reports no gap;
  the wall     no socket left the box and no order left the stand-in.

The stand-in's book does not move on a fill, so this file gives it the
one piece of broker arithmetic it lacks — a filled sell reduces the
position and raises cash — attached from the outside the way
`ops/rehearsal/broker_amend.py` attaches the amend endpoint. Nothing the
desk decides is modelled; only what a broker's ledger does after a fill.

NOT COVERED: the morning lane's conviction-ordered cut (it needs a fresh
per-seat read and a PM book); the ROTATION path — a held name judged
below the entry bar and sold to fund a new name — which is a Portfolio
Manager decision rendered into its prompt, so no deterministic input
drives it; a trim that the stand-in cannot fill in whole; shorts; the
cash-sweep vehicle; anything a model seat says — every seat is scripted.
