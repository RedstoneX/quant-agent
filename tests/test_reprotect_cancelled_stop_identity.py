"""INCIDENT 2026-09-30 (AAPL) — the reprotect idempotency check must not be
satisfied by the stop THIS run just cancelled.

Production log, 14:47:23: the WAL intent was written, 2 protective stops
were cancelled, the SELL went out, and 486ms later the idempotency check
listed those same just-cancelled orders as still open (Alpaca's cancel is
asynchronous and its OPEN filter includes `pending_cancel`), matched
`best_stop`, logged "idempotent re-run", returned True — so the drain
caller deleted the recovery row and ~$2,500 sat with no stop and no record
that one was owed.

The distinction is by broker order IDENTITY, not by timing and not by a
tolerance. These tests pin both directions: the just-cancelled order must
NOT satisfy the check (a stop is placed), and a genuinely live stop from a
PREVIOUS attempt must still satisfy it (the duplicate-stop protection the
2026-05-27 audit note describes is not weakened).
