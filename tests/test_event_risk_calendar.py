"""Event risk is answered from fetched data, not from the model's memory.

Two recorded defects are pinned here.

(c) `MarketDataProvider.get_next_earnings_date` existed specifically to ground
    `RiskVerdict.reasoning_chain.event_risk` — a REQUIRED narrative field — and
    had ZERO callers anywhere in src/ or tests/. The tests below prove the
    fetched figure now reaches the Risk Manager's actual input text, not merely
    that the function got called.

(d) No macro event calendar existed at all, so "is there an FOMC decision or a
    CPI/NFP release coming?" was answered from recollection.

The degraded paths matter as much as the happy ones: this project's standing
rule is that a labelled absence beats a fabricated figure (`pace_status` /
`unavailable_no_pinned_horizon` is the reference). Every failure mode below is
asserted to REACH the seat as an explicit unknown, never as silence and never
as an empty calendar that reads like a calm one.
