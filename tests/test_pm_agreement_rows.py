# --- Cost: the all-zero agreement rows ------------------------------------
#
# MEASURED on a recorded production briefing (2026-10-04): 38 of the block's
# 82 rows read `0 aligned / 0 opposed` on BOTH sides, 6,768 of 87,234
# characters (7.8%), at the seat that is 91% of all model spend. A row that
# states no source took either side states nothing. It is omitted and
# COUNTED, so the seat can still tell "no coverage either way" from "this
# symbol is not in the registry". The deterministic refusal is untouched by
# this: `PortfolioConstructor` re-derives `signed_source_score` from the
# registry object, never from the text rendered here.
# Re-MEASURED 2026-10-04 on the same recorded briefing: every one of the 38
# all-zero rows carries the identical "macro stance broadcast" boilerplate,
# so dropping only caveat-free rows would have dropped NOTHING. An all-zero
# row goes whatever caveat it carries; what the caveats conveyed is carried
# by the breakdown on the single summary line.
