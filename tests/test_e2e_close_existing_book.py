"""The hermetic CLOSE session, starting with a position already on the book.

tests/test_e2e_morning_session.py and tests/test_e2e_morning_protection.py
drive a morning session on an EMPTY book and judge the buy it makes. This
file drives `TradingPipeline(config).run_close()` on a book that already
holds one long with one resting protective stop — the same production
objects, the same seat seam, the same rehearsal broker stand-in and the
same socket-level network wall — and judges what the desk does WITH it.

The reviewer seat says HOLD in every case but one, so what the desk does
is decided by the INPUTS (the bars, the price, the resting stop), and every
expectation is derived from those inputs, never read back from the run:

  loaded        the held position is read from the broker stand-in, the
                seat sees exactly one position, and exactly one SELL stop
                rests behind it at the level that was on the book;
  exit          when the chart's own alignment reading says the move is
                over (`src/risk/alignment_exit.py`: the close sits below
                the last confirmed higher low) the desk sells the WHOLE
                position after clearing its stop; when no swing low has
                been broken it sells nothing — whatever the seat says;
  ratchet       the +1R breakeven ratchet (`src/risk/trailing.py`) moves
                the stop to the entry price when price >= entry + 1R and
                does NOT move it when price is short of +1R;
  one-way       a resting stop already ABOVE breakeven is left where it
                is when the ratchet would otherwise propose breakeven; a
                reviewer TRAIL_STOP below the resting stop is refused —
                a stop never moves in the direction that widens risk;
  the wall      no socket left the box and no order left the stand-in.

NOT COVERED: rotation / de-levering / the gross ceiling (one name, inside
every limit); the re-protect path after a PARTIAL fill (the stand-in fills
whole, so the WAL restore is driven only as far as "stop cleared before
the sell"); shorts; fractional legs; the structural / chandelier trail and
the SMA200 mark; anything a model seat says — every seat is scripted.
