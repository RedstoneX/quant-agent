"""Item 99(b): the technical seat's prompt must name every data block it is
actually sent, and must claim none it is not.

The enforcement is exact-match only: a label the renderer emits, or a label the
message builder writes into its f-string, either appears in the registry below
with a phrase that is present in the prompt, or this fails. There is no
similarity score and no threshold to tune — the desk rejected a blanket scan of
prompt prose on this item, and this is the opposite of one: it keys off the
strings the code itself produces.
