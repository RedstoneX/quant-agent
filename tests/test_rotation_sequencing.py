"""Board item 39 — a rotation SELL may not fire ahead of a replacement BUY
that is going to be refused.

The defect these pin: the `ranked_margin` rotation tier sells a held
position purely to fund a specific replacement. Every gate that can refuse
that replacement runs LATER in `ExecutionStage._run_session` than the SELL
loop does, so the desk could end the session sold out of a position with
nothing bought in its place and only an owner alert behind it.

Two earlier fixes failed review:

  * attempt 1 closed one refusal path and turned the structural barrier in
    front of the tier into a config boolean, which is a weaker guard than
    the one it replaced;
  * attempt 2 re-ran the daily-loss gate using PRE-SALE account state. The
    real gate recomputes from `ctx.positions` AFTER the sale, on BOTH sides
    of its comparison — the numerator is the held book's own intraday
    change and the volatility-relative rung of the threshold is measured
    from the held book too — so a pre-sale check is structurally blind to
    the state change the real check depends on.

What is pinned here:

  * a winner sold out of a losing book: pre-sale the daily-loss gate
    passes, post-sale it trips, and the fix withdraws BOTH legs rather
    than selling into a buy that will be refused (the failure attempt 2
    cannot see);
  * the projection moves the THRESHOLD as well as the loss;
  * each of the four downstream refusal paths — daily-loss, no_price,
    stale_entry, qty_zero — withdraws both legs;
  * exits earlier in the SAME session are applied to the projection too;
  * the barrier in front of the sale is a `RotationClearance` object and
    not a flag: `rotation_sell_reason` raises without one, raises for one
    minted for a different pair, and raises for one missing a gate, with no
    config read anywhere in the refusal;
  * `REQUIRED_BUY_LEG_GATES` and the gate function cannot silently stop
    agreeing;
  * the flag stays OFF by default and a MagicMock config never reads as on.
