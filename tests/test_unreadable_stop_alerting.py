"""Board item 172 — a protective stop the broker CANNOT BE ASKED about.

THE DEFECT, and why it is a defect NOW. Removing the account-level loss
alarm (retired item 32, owner instruction 2026-09-20) made per-position
stops the desk's only loss protection. The halt's own coverage check was
the one path that told the owner, BY SYMBOL, that a stop could not be READ
at the broker — which is a different statement from "there is no stop".
Both surviving readers failed quiet:

  * `TradingPipeline._reconcile_stop_coverage` logged a WARNING and
    `continue`d, so the symbol vanished from `stop_coverage_gaps` and read
    downstream exactly like a position confirmed covered;
  * `coverage_watchdog.uncovered_positions` did `return [], error` on the
    FIRST symbol that raised, discarding every gap already found and every
    symbol not yet reached — so one flaky name could hide a genuinely naked
    position standing behind it in the list.

THE LOAD-BEARING NEGATIVE TEST is the fractional one. A sub-share remainder
whose DAY stop has legitimately lapsed overnight is the accepted,
owner-ratified exposure and happens to every fractional position every
night — roughly $2,400 across ten positions on the 2026-09-22 close. If it
were reported as "unreadable" the real signal would arrive buried in ten
lines of expected noise, which is the same way a banner gets tuned out.
That case MUST stay a measured `fractional_overnight` gap.

THIS SUITE WAS ITSELF CHECKED BY MUTATION. Thirteen deliberate reversions
were applied one at a time and each was caught by at least one failing test
[measured 2026-09-23]: restoring both original defects, restoring the
broker's swallowed listing error, making each reader ignore `ok=False`,
reintroducing the non-list crash, removing the per-symbol dedup, dropping
its case normalisation, letting an unreadable pass report `clean`, folding
the row into the MIS-SIZED banner and into WATCH, downgrading a genuinely
empty order book to unreadable, and reclassifying the accepted fractional
lapse as unreadable. A test suite nobody tried to break is a suite nobody
knows the strength of.

Nothing here touches the network, a real broker, or a real chat.

    consults before paging, and nothing else in the file was asserting on
    it: a mutation turning it into `return False` silenced the 30-minute
    sweep's alert with every test in the suite still green [measured
    2026-09-23]. The session reconciler does not cover this — it is a
    different process on a different trigger, and between two sessions the
    standalone sweep is the only thing looking.

    It must also stay UNGATED on `session_ran`, unlike `should_alert`:
    nothing re-reads a stop the broker refused to describe, so waiting for
    a session to have its chance would only delay the report.
