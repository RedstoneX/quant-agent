"""The trail evaluates a candidate SET, not the first candidate it finds.

Board items 195 and 196. `evaluate_trailing_stop` used to build the
chandelier only when the structural pivot produced nothing, so it committed
to one candidate BEFORE testing it against the invariants. A structural pivot
that the noise band then rejected silently suppressed a chandelier level that
would have passed — the structural leg could block protection it could not
itself provide.

These tests pin the widened search and, just as deliberately, pin the case it
does NOT rescue: when the chandelier is itself inside the noise band there is
no lower already-derived level, and nothing is synthesised at the band's own
edge, because a level read off today's price is a price-follower rather than
a structural stop. No multiple or threshold is introduced or moved here.
