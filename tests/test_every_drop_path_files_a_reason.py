"""Board item 10: a candidate is NEVER dropped without a machine-readable reason.

Two tests, doing two different jobs, because the defect this file exists for
has now recurred three times (funnel-queue item 2 on 2026-09-03, retired
board item 49 on 2026-09-14, board item 10's first pass the same day) and
each fix was a list of individual sites believed complete at the time.

`test_the_archive_replays_with_a_reason_on_every_dropped_candidate` is the
EMPIRICAL half: it runs the real `PortfolioConstructor.construct_orders` over
every PM target the live desk actually wrote between 2026-08-18 and
2026-09-02 — real targets, real technical analyses, the real seat-stance
registry, the real held book and the session's own equity, all read out of
the production archive and frozen into
`tests/fixtures/constructor_drop_paths_archive.json`. No stub stands in for
any of it. The claim it settles is the one board item 10 said needed the desk
to trade again: every candidate that produces no order carries a durable,
per-symbol, machine-readable reason.

`test_every_drop_site_in_the_constructor_files_a_reason` is the STANDING
GUARD, and is worth more than either fix: it parses `portfolio_constructor.py`
and fails when a NEW way to end a candidate is added without one. A replay
only covers the paths its recorded inputs happen to reach; the AST scan covers
the ones nobody has hit yet, which is exactly the class every previous pass
missed.

    """The regex-miss board item 10's first pass did not find — and the
    honest limit of that finding.

    `_widen_stop_past_noise` refuses on three inputs the schema forbids but
    an older persisted row or a hand-built object can still carry: no stop
    and no ATR to derive one from, a non-finite stop, a non-finite entry. The
    first of those three logged "Constructor: BUY MU has no stop ..." — the
    capture's pattern needs rejected|refused|skipped straight after the
    symbol, so a candidate dropped there reached the record as the literal
    "no matching constructor log line captured", the exact signature the
    first pass reported as eliminated. All three now file a code.

    And the part that must not be overstated: NONE of the three is reachable
    through `construct_orders` as the code stands. A missing or non-finite
    ATR makes `_derive_target` file a data fault one step earlier, and a
    non-finite stop fails the `> 0` test in `_resolve_stop` and is replaced
    by the instrument's own band. That is pinned below, so the day a change
    opens one of these up, the record already says what it will say.
