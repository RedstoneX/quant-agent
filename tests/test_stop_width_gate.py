"""docs/WORK.md item 54, 2026-09-12 — the stop is always derivable, and the
gate is on its WIDTH, not on whether a level exists under it.

What shipped in the morning (PR #330, "no floor, no trade") was replaced the
same day on sourced research, before it ran a session:

  * No published method refuses a trade for lack of support below.
    Chandelier, Parabolic SAR, the Darvas box bottom and Kullamägi's
    entry-bar low all place a stop with no level at all
    (https://qullamaggie.com/my-3-timeless-setups-that-have-made-me-tens-of-millions/).
  * The gap branch was backwards, and it is measured: a rising window holds
    as support only ~20% of the time (Bulkowski,
    https://thepatternsite.com/GaugingGaps.html), so the level beneath a
    gap is MORE reachable, not void.
  * The rule was adversely selected: nearness to the 52-week high forecasts
    returns (George & Hwang 2004, Journal of Finance,
    https://www.bauer.uh.edu/tgeorge/papers/gh4-paper.pdf) and the rule
    refused exactly that population.
  * What published practice constrains is the stop's WIDTH; the answer to
    a wide stop is a smaller position (Van Tharp sizing), not refusal.

Pinned here: (1) the level scan's relevance window is still read from the
instrument (kept from #330); (2) an unbacked or missing stop is read from
the instrument — the wider of the ATR noise band and the signal bar's far
edge; (3) **the width REFUSAL is GONE** (board item 56, route (c),
2026-09-26) and cannot come back silently — see
`TestTheWidthGateIsDeletedAndCannotComeBack`; (4) a listing too young to
measure is refused by its own code, first; (5) a wider stop buys a smaller
position at the same dollars of risk, and that is now the ONLY answer to
width; (6) nothing anywhere refuses for absent structure any more, and the
gap branch is gone.

**2026-09-26, docs/WORK.md item 56, route (c) — the width gate is deleted.**
The question the item narrowed to was "at what probability of being touched
inside the trade's own horizon does a stop stop being a stop". Three routes
were open; this is why the other two were rejected and this one taken.

  * Route (a), a CITED touch probability: no published work measures that
    quantity. What the stop-loss literature measures is the RETURN and
    VOLATILITY effect of a stop threshold (Acar & Toffel 2000; Han, Zhou &
    Zhu on momentum stop-losses; Kaminski & Lo), never a minimum touch
    probability below which a level stops counting as a stop. A different
    quantity, so it is not adopted.
  * Route (b), the THRESHOLD-FREE reformulation the item proposed — refuse
    when the stop's touch probability is below the target's reach
    probability on the same instrument — is NOT threshold-free. Both
    probabilities read the same ATR over the same horizon, and
    `touch_probability` is strictly decreasing in width, so the inequality
    is exactly `stop_distance > target_distance`: a reward:risk floor of
    1.0 wearing a probability costume. The desk deleted its reward:risk
    floor on 2026-09-24 (board item 81) and the owner ruled twice
    (2026-09-11, restated 2026-09-17) that a breakout setup gets no
    reward-side refusal at all. Pinned by
    `test_the_threshold_free_reformulation_is_a_reward_risk_floor`.
  * Route (c), DELETE, is what shipped, on a measurement: across 648 sized
    stops recorded in production between 2026-09-13 and 2026-09-26
    (`quant_agent.log`, the item-56 touch-probability reading) the gate
    refused ZERO trades; the widest stop it ever saw sat at 1.29 x ATR x
    sqrt(H) against its 1.5 cap; the lowest touch probability ever recorded
    was 4.0% against a gate that refuses at 1.67%. It never protected
    anything that `_plan_risk_targets` sizing down (spec 2.1) and, at the
    extreme, `position_sized_to_zero` do not already answer.

The READING survives, unchanged and still stamped on every sized stop: it
is the evidence that could one day answer the question the gate pretended
to have answered.
