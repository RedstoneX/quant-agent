"""A credential-gateway / LLM-provider outage must not reach the broker.

`docs/WORK.md`'s commissioning checklist requires objective evidence that
"failure of OneCLI or Mission Control fails safely and does not create a
path to unauthorized live trading." The Mission Control half of that is
covered in `tests/test_api_contract.py`. This file covers the trading-engine
half, which the OneCLI dependency newly makes relevant: when the credential
gateway is down, every LLM call raises after its retry budget
(`BaseAgent._execute` re-raises the primary error when no failover
succeeds), and the question is what the pipeline does with that.

The invariant asserted here is deliberately the blunt one — **no order is
submitted** — because that is the property that actually matters for
safety, and it holds however the failure is reported upward.

These are behaviour tests only: nothing in `src/` is changed by this file,
and none of them assert a *new* semantic. They pin the existing fail-closed
behaviour so a future refactor cannot quietly turn an agent outage into a
session that trades on partial reasoning.

Harness mirrors `tests/test_pipeline.py` (same patch stack, same mock
shapes); the config fixture is duplicated locally rather than promoted to
conftest so this file's failure modes stay self-contained.
