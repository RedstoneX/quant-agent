"""Phase 9 §9.5 — the conviction ledger's recording and scoring layer.

Covers:
  - src/conviction_ledger.py — score_position / aggregate_seat_records /
    summarize_closed_position (pure logic, no I/O)
  - src/storage/db.py — link_nominations_to_decision, record_seat_stances,
    resolve_conviction_ledger, get_conviction_credits
  - src/pipeline_stages.py — _link_nominations_to_decision /
    _record_seat_stances, and the guarantee that neither can move a
    trading decision

NOT covered here (out of scope by the brief): any UI, API route, or
consumption of the ledger by sizing/risk. §9.5's operator-facing view is a
later change.
