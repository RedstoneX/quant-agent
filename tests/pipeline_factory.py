"""The ONE way a test builds a TradingPipeline: through the real `__init__`.

Why this module exists
----------------------
81 test files (measured 2026-10-01) built the pipeline with
``TradingPipeline.__new__(TradingPipeline)`` and then bolted collaborators on
afterwards. A pipeline built that way never ran its constructor, so every
service the constructor wires (risk gate, stages, sweeper, ...) was missing or
wired to nothing — which is exactly why each service pulled out of
src/pipeline.py had to leave a delegating mixin behind that rebuilds the
service from live attributes on every call. The half-built object was the
cause; the delegators were the patch. This factory removes the cause.

How it works
------------
``build_pipeline(**stand_ins)`` loads the production ``config/settings.yaml``
through the production loader (sentinel credentials, repointed at the test's
isolated cwd, in-memory DB, retries off) and calls the REAL
``TradingPipeline.__init__``. Each keyword names a pipeline attribute and
supplies the object the test wants there:

* a name in ``CONSTRUCTOR_SITES`` is injected AT THE CONSTRUCTOR SITE — the
  class the constructor would have called is patched to hand back the
  stand-in — so every service the constructor wires sees it (the risk gate
  holds the test's ``db``, the market feed falls back to the test's
  ``broker``, ...). Overriding ``pipeline.db`` after construction would NOT do
  that, which is the whole point.
* any other name (a private method stub such as ``_atr_for_symbol``, a plain
  state attribute such as ``_last_symbol_sectors``) is set on the built
  instance; a method looked up at call time sees it.

Defaults: ``broker`` is a ``MagicMock`` (no test wants a real Alpaca client);
``db`` is a real in-memory ``Database``; everything else is the genuine
collaborator, built exactly as production builds it. Nothing here opens a
network connection: the data providers and model seats defer all I/O to their
methods, and tests/conftest.py refuses outbound HTTP anyway.

    pipeline = build_pipeline(broker=my_broker)
    pipeline = build_pipeline(db=MagicMock(), _atr_for_symbol=lambda s: 1.0)

tests/test_pipeline_new_ratchet.py counts the ``__new__`` sites here and on
``origin/main``; that number may only go down.
