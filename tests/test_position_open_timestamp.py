"""`Database.get_position_open_timestamp` — the trail's bar window starts at
the POSITION OPEN, not at the most recent add.

Measured 2026-09-30 against the live production DB: the deterministic trail
sliced its bars from `get_symbol_last_buy`, i.e. the LATEST opening row, while
taking the entry PRICE from `position.avg_entry`, which is blended across every
add. MRVL's position `pos-08b43df53103` opened 2026-09-17 and took a third add
on 2026-09-23 at 17:19; the 19:31 trail evaluation that day therefore saw ZERO
bars "since entry" for a position four sessions old, and
`src/risk/trailing.py::_swing_lows` — which needs `2 * PIVOT_WINDOW + 1` = 7
bars before it can confirm one pivot — had nothing to read.

These tests pin the lookup itself and the one property it really has: the
open is never AFTER the last buy, so the window only ever LENGTHENS. That is
NOT the same as "cannot remove protection", which an earlier version of this
docstring claimed. A longer window raises the chandelier's high-water anchor,
and `evaluate_trailing_stop` refuses outright once the candidate rises through
its noise floor, so a wider window can cost a tighten. The change is justified
by consistency with the blended `avg_entry` price, and its cost was measured
at zero across all 21 recorded refusals (see `src/risk/trailing.py::_swing_lows`).
