"""Item 90 / number ledger — the recording behind the two nomination caps.

`nominations.max_per_seat_per_run` (3) and `nominations.max_total_per_run`
(6) are unsourced round numbers. Neither can be settled by argument: the
open question is whether offered demand ever reaches either cap, and what
is discarded when it does. These cover `src/nominations.py`'s
`measure_cap_demand`, the recording that makes a run of real sessions
answer that, and pin that it changes nothing the desk selects.

# sessions readable: it must report offered-versus-kept per seat, name what
# each cap dropped, and never change what `select_nominations` returns.
