"""Regression: the rehearsal verdict must not call a healthy session a FAIL.

Additional regression: for intra_check sessions, the nested
result["intraday_scan"]["status"] must be extracted and used as the report
status, not the top-level "ok" status. This mirrors production's
src/trader_feed.py behavior and makes the nested statuses intraday_no_trades
and intraday_executed actually reachable in the rig's reporting.

Found running the rig against real production history (2026-08-29): plain,
uneventful `midday`, `close` and `intra_check` rehearsals — no crash, no
missing recording, no blocked agent, nothing stopped — all came back
`VERDICT: FAIL` because `report.py`'s status vocabulary had not kept up with
`src/pipeline.py`'s. `run_position_review` (shared by midday/close) returns
"reviewed" for both "no positions to review" and "reviewed them successfully"
— only "position_review_parse_error" is the real failure. `run_intra_check`
returns "ok" when there is no loss violation or no positions — a normal,
majority-of-the-time outcome for a session that runs every 30 minutes.
`run_evening` returns "analyzed" on success. Production's own
`src/trader_feed.py` (groups "reviewed", "intraday_no_trades", "no_trades",
"ok") and `src/notifier.py` (groups "executed", "analyzed", "reviewed",
"preprocessed", "reflected") already treat these as healthy completions, not
failures — the rig disagreeing with production about what counts as "the
session worked" is exactly the kind of dishonest output this harness exists
to avoid producing itself.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Derive, from source, every terminal status a SESSIONS-mapped session (plus
# run_earnings_preprocess) can hand back as `report.status` -- see
# test_every_known_pipeline_terminal_status_is_classified below for why this
# exists instead of a hand-maintained list.
#
# A plain `ast.walk` over the whole of src/pipeline.py for every dict literal
# keyed "status" was tried first and rejected: it also matches unrelated
# "status" keys that are never a session's terminal status (an embedded
# sub-report like `smart_money_refresh = {"status": "disabled"}`, or an
# `agent_logs`-write kwargs dict) and it does not resolve indirection at all,
# so it misses real statuses that are not literals at their `"status": ...`
# site. Two kinds of indirection are structural, not incidental, so they are
# bridged explicitly below rather than discovered generically:
#
#   1. A handful of statuses are decided by a ternary at the dict-literal
#      site itself, e.g. `"status": "reviewed" if ... else
#      "position_review_parse_error"` (run_position_review) or the doubly
#      nested one in run_evening ("analyzed" / "evening_analysis_error" /
#      "evening_parse_error"). `_status_literals` below walks into both
#      branches of an `ast.IfExp`, recursively.
#
#   2. A few statuses are constructed in a *different* function/method than
#      the one that returns them to the caller -- the value flows back as a
#      bare `return NAME`, where NAME's dict literal lives elsewhere. Found
#      by walking each scanned function for `return NAME` where NAME was
#      last assigned from a *call* rather than a dict literal (see the
#      `_BRIDGES` list below for exactly which four calls these are and
#      where each one's real dict literal lives). This is the case the
#      previous hand-list's docstring cited for `pm_agent_failure` and the
#      four `pm_*` statuses (three call frames into
#      src/agents/portfolio_manager.py's `_semantic_failure`) -- true, and
#      handled below -- but the *same* shape also applies to
#      `hard_risk_block` / `agent_failure` / `rejected` / `symbol_block`
#      (RiskStage.run, a different file: src/pipeline_stages.py),
#      `emergency_sold` (`_check_late_breach_and_emergency_liquidate`) and
#      `paid_analysis_suspended` (`_paid_suspended_payload`) -- both in
#      pipeline.py but in a shared helper, not at the `return` site.
#
# run_intra_check has its own nested-indirection wrinkle: the opportunity
# scan's outcome is assigned to a local (`scan_result`) that is never itself
# `return`-ed -- it is embedded as `result["intraday_scan"] = scan_result`
# and *that* dict is returned. This mirrors exactly how
# ops/rehearsal/report.py's own `collect()` reads it back (`result.get(
# "intraday_scan")`), so `_names_of_interest` below extends "returned names"
# to include the right-hand side of that one specific subscript assignment.
#
# What this does NOT attempt: a fully generic call graph (following an
# arbitrary `self.foo(...)` to `foo`'s body, anywhere, unbounded). The four
# bridges below were found by inspecting every `return NAME` in the scanned
# functions whose NAME traces to a call rather than a literal (this file's
# derivation script prints them; none were left unresolved as of 2026-08-31).
# A fully generic resolver would also have to disambiguate same-named
# methods on unrelated classes (pipeline_stages.py alone defines four
# different `run` methods) -- attempting that generically risked silently
# resolving to the *wrong* one, which would be a worse failure mode than the
# hand list this replaces. If a future refactor adds a fifth bridge, this
# derivation raises AssertionError (a bare `return NAME` this file's helpers
# do not know how to resolve is *not* silently skipped -- see
# `_assert_no_unresolved_bridges` below), rather than silently under-counting.

# INCONCLUSIVE — "the rig could not judge" is not the same claim as "the code
# is broken", and until 2026-09-02 the report made them look identical.
#
# An unpinned rehearsal replayed the morning's decision stage using a
# portfolio-manager answer recorded in a DIFFERENT session (`intra_check-
# d0909ddc`, agent_logs row 312, a real decision about ZS) instead of the
# morning's own row 309. The grounding check compared that decision against a
# morning that never analysed ZS and reported `pm_grounding_error` — printed
# exactly like a genuine defect, and argued about for an hour as if it were
# one. See docs/INCIDENT_HISTORY.md, "the rehearsal rig's verdict was a coin
# flip", and `_replay_fidelity` in ops/rehearsal/report.py.
#
# These tests pin BOTH directions. The downgrade must fire on the transplant,
# and must NOT fire on the same symptom when the replay was faithful — a
# genuine defect being quietly relabelled "inconclusive" would be a strictly
# worse gate than the coin flip it replaced.
