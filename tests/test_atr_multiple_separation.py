"""The 1.0 ATR multiples must stay SEPARATE, honestly-marked numbers.

The entry-anchored noise band (`NOISE_BAND_ATR_MULTIPLE`) was one of four
until 2026-10-09, when the owner ruled that no sale is refused for the price
the desk paid and the gate was removed with its constant. Three remain.

Board item 70 was opened because one `1.0` literal did two different jobs in the
exit path. The split is built: the adverse-move noise band, the break-confirmation
margin, the last-resort fallback protection margin and the absolute minimum stop
multiple are four distinct names. Item 213 carries the leftover — none of them is
sourced yet.

This test pins BEHAVIOUR IS UNCHANGED (all four still read 1.0) and pins the
SEPARATION (they are four names, not one shared constant), so a future sourcing
pass cannot silently re-collapse them or retune one by moving another.

`FALLBACK_PROTECTION_ATR_MULTIPLE` is the newest and least-guarded of the four
(split out of the noise band on 2026-10-04) and its ledger row was covered by
nothing here, so the one layer at which a re-collapse has actually happened
before — ledger prose and `derived_from` — was unguarded for it.
