"""Layer 2 — does the ONE implementation produce the RIGHT number on the book
that used to break it?

What this file used to be, and why it changed
---------------------------------------------
The 2026-09-01 survey found six defects behind 4,110 passing tests. Not one of
them was a component computing its own answer wrongly; every component was
self-consistent and self-tested. They were SEAM defects — two components each
computing the same named quantity a different way, judged against a shared
threshold, with no test in the repo comparing them.

So this file was written to compare implementation against implementation, and
it FAILED on purpose: that failure was its validation. The consolidation has
now landed. Each of those quantities has exactly one definition, and comparing
a function to itself proves nothing — a test that passes no matter what the
code does is worse than no test, because it reads as coverage.

What it is now
--------------
The valuable asset here is `tests/book_fixtures.py`: books built so a NAIVE and
a CORRECT implementation return DIFFERENT numbers, with the arithmetic worked
out by hand in each fixture's docstring. This file is the conformance layer
over those fixtures. Every test below pins the EXACT number the single source
must produce on the adversarial book — the net-short book, the leveraged
inverse book, the winning short, the halted session — and states the wrong
answer the pre-fix implementation gave beside it.

That earns its keep in two directions:

  * Mutate a single source and these fail, because they assert values rather
    than agreement.
  * Change a fixture's numbers without updating its docstring and these fail
    too, which keeps the shared fixture module honest for every other test
    that adopts it.

Where a REAL seam still exists it is still compared, and there is exactly one
left worth the name: `src/risk/rules.py` and `src/quantities.py` each carry a
net-exposure implementation and CANNOT be merged, because a ratified guardrail
(`tests/test_api_safety.py`) forbids `src/api/` from importing `src.risk`. The
cockpit's gauge is drawn against the engine's ceiling, so the two must agree —
see Quantity 5, which also documents the one place they are deliberately NOT
interchangeable.

Deliberately NOT duplicated here
--------------------------------
Three sibling files already exercise the consolidated functions against their
own hand-rolled books, and this file does not restate them:

  * `tests/test_one_definition_per_quantity.py` — book exposure, position
    weight and P&L percent, plus AST guards against a second definition.
  * `tests/test_single_definition_quantities.py` — deployable cash, "%
    deployed", dollar volume and the inverse-ETF roster, engine vs API.
  * `tests/test_atr_is_wilder_everywhere.py` — the ATR consolidation in full.

What this file adds is those functions measured on the SHARED hostile books,
including cases none of the three cover: a book that is net short, and a book
whose only leveraged holding is a -3x inverse ETF held long.
