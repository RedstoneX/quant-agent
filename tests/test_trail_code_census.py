"""Item 196: the per-run census of trail outcomes.

`record_trail_state_if_changed` writes nothing when a stock refuses for
the same reason twice running, so it can say WHY a stop has not moved and
never HOW OFTEN. These pin the census that answers the frequency question,
and the refusal it exists to count.
