"""Layer 3 — one definition per quantity, enforced against the AST.

Layer 2 (`tests/test_cross_consistency.py`) catches the six defects we already
know about. This file is the one that catches the SEVENTH, before anyone
measures it.

Why the AST and not grep
------------------------
The two average-true-range implementations share no name, no file, no
signature and no import. One is `_atr_series` doing `np.convolve` over true
ranges; the other is `ta.volatility.AverageTrueRange`. Searching for "atr"
finds one of them. Searching for the other finds nothing. What they have in
common is the ARITHMETIC — and arithmetic is exactly what an AST can see.

So each entry in `REGISTRY` below names a quantity, names the ONE function
sanctioned to compute it, and carries a matcher that recognises the *shape* of
the computation wherever it appears. A second site performing that shape is a
second definition, and a second definition is the defect class this file
exists to make impossible.

Precedent: `tests/test_gross_exposure_ladder.py::
test_trimming_the_held_book_has_exactly_one_owner` restricts authorship of
de-lever orders to exactly one caller by walking the AST for `Call` nodes.
This file follows that shape and generalises it from one call to a registry of
arithmetic patterns.

Keeping it trustworthy
----------------------
A guard that flags correct code is disabled within a week, and then there is
nothing. Two rules keep this one honest:

1. Every matcher is written to recognise a *wrong-shaped* computation, not
   merely a computation. `percent_of_book` does not flag every division by
   equity — the codebase has eleven legitimate ones. It flags a division by
   equity whose numerator came from `market_value` WITHOUT a leverage
   multiplier, which is what actually distinguishes the broken sites from the
   sound ones.

2. Every failure names the file, the line, the enclosing function and the
   sanctioned function that should have been called instead. A guard nobody
   can act on gets deleted.

Changing the registry is allowed and expected — consolidating a quantity into a
different owner than the one named here is a one-line edit. Making that edit
deliberately, in a reviewed diff, is the entire point.

#: several deliberately different implementations taking different inputs
#: (planned entry/stop/target versus the constructed order), each documented as
#: distinct. Sector concentration and gross exposure are genuinely
#: single-sourced. `RiskRuleEngine.check` is included because it is the single

#: its divisions is correctly leverage-aware — if a matcher is going to produce
#: a false positive anywhere, it produces it here first.
