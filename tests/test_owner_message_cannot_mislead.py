"""Guards for the owner-facing defects under `docs/WORK.md` item 89 that
can mislead a trading decision — not the thirteen clarity ones.

The owner has a standing preference against test-writing. These exist
anyway, and only these, because each one pins a message that could have
moved real money: a plan discarded with no notification, a header that
disagreed with the list beneath it, an entry reason reported as missing
while it sat in the records, and a rule cited by a number whose text said
the opposite.

Every test here drives the real formatter over a real SQLite file. No
broker is involved; where one would be, the check is on `isinstance`, not
on truthiness, because ~58 tests in this suite drive a MagicMock broker
and a MagicMock is always truthy.
