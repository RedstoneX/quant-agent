"""The share count must divide by the price the desk is ABOUT TO PAY.

MEASURED DEFECT (2026-10-04, live money). Position size came from the
ANALYSIS price and the stop distance implied by it, while the order actually
submitted is a MARKETABLE LIMIT priced AWAY from that reference so it fills
— a ceiling ABOVE it for a BUY, a floor BELOW it for a SHORT. The realised
distance from the fill to the stop is therefore WIDER than the distance the
share count was computed against, so the same share count carries MORE money
at risk than the ~1% of equity that was authorised. Over the desk's own
recorded BUY rows the median overshoot is 6.1% of the risk budget (25% at
the worst); a short case measured 10.9%.

These tests drive the REAL `ExecutionStage` submit loop (the harness pattern
of `tests/test_item_181_short_risk_budget_sizing.py`), capture BOTH the
divisor handed to the risk-budget sizer AND the limit price actually handed
to the broker, and assert the REALISED risk per share — limit-to-stop, the
worst price the submitted order can fill at — equals the risk per share the
size was computed from. Pre-fix both directions fail; post-fix both pass,
and they fail identically in both directions, so no asymmetry can be
reintroduced (owner ruling 2026-10-04: a short is treated exactly like a
long).
