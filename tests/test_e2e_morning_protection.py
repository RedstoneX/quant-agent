"""The hermetic morning session, judged on WHAT it decided and HOW it protected it.

tests/test_e2e_morning_session.py drives the whole session (read it first)
and checks its SHAPE: four stages, in order, every seat before the PM, the
PM before the RM, a BUY reaching the broker stand-in. This file runs the
SAME session once more and checks the part the shape check cannot see:

  size        the buy is the PM's weight of the snapshot's cash, in WHOLE
              shares (fractionability fails closed offline) at the ask
              the desk pays — derived from the inputs, never read back
              from the output and compared with itself;
  protection  exactly one GTC SELL stop rests behind the fill, for its
              whole size, below the entry, at the level the session itself
              recorded, submitted after the fill it protects; the
              broker-truth coverage audit reports no gap;
  the wall    the rehearsal's socket-level network wall (the same one a
              production rehearsal runs under) journalled no attempt to
              leave the box.

Measured 2026-10-02: with protective-stop placement broken to submit
nothing, the session still reported `executed` and the shape test stayed
GREEN; this file is what turns that red.

It lives in its own file because the file-size ratchet refuses growth of
tests/test_e2e_morning_session.py against origin/main, and because the
boundary ratchet counts files that build a TradingPipeline by name — this
one only calls the existing harness.

NOT COVERED: midday / close / evening sessions; an existing book (exits,
rotation, de-levering, stop ratchets, the re-protect path); partial or
unfilled fills; shorts; provider failover under fault; anything a model
seat says — every seat answers from a script.
