"""Board item 186 — the realised total at-risk and the per-cluster shares of
it, one durable row per run.

WHY. `max_portfolio_risk_pct` (25) and `max_cluster_risk_share_pct` (40) are
owner-ratified appetite with no measurement behind either, and the owner's
2026-09-30 ruling ("risk is never a global dial") bars picking a replacement
value. What is buildable without inventing a number is the OBSERVATION: write
down what the book's realised concentration actually was, session by session.

RECORDING ONLY. These tests assert the row's shape, its unit and its NULL
discipline. Nothing here derives, tunes or proposes a ceiling, and nothing in
the product reads these rows back into a sizing, ordering or refusal decision.
