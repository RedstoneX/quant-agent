"""Phase 10.1 — one failing leg must die alone.

`RiskVerdict.approved` was a single bool for the whole plan, and
`RiskModification` could retune a symbol but not refuse one. So the only way
the risk manager could say "not this trade" was to say "not any trade".

Production evidence, run `run-64290730` (2026-09-01 morning): the verdict
rejected the entire plan citing XLE alone — constructed R/R 1.18, under the
1.5 floor — and CHPX died with it at R/R 3.03, a different sector and an
unrelated technical thesis. Zero trades that morning. CHPX was never judged;
it was standing next to XLE.

`rejected_symbols` gives the verdict a per-symbol outcome, so one failing leg
no longer takes the batch with it.

Owner ruling 2026-09-24 (final) went further: the risk seat has NO whole-batch
veto at all. `approved=False` is a no-op for batch rejection — recorded, then
the plan proceeds. The seat reduces risk ONLY by dropping a NEW entry
(`rejected_symbols`), shrinking (`scale_all_buys` to 0.0, `modifications`), and
never by stopping the plan. A protective exit (SELL/COVER) or existing holding
can never be dropped or blocked by the seat. The hard limits stay enforced by
the deterministic gate, before and after scaling. The second half of this file
pins that ruling.

No threshold moves here.
