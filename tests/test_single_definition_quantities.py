"""One definition per quantity — drift regression tests.

Four numbers in this system were computed independently in two or three
places and disagreed with each other. Measured on identical inputs before
the fix:

  deployable cash   engine $54,000 vs dashboard $34,100   (1.58x apart)
  "% deployed"      risk rule 40.68% vs cockpit 54.24%    (13.56pp apart)
  20-day $ volume   $11.400M / $12.000M / $11.429M        (5.26% spread)
  inverse-ETF set   agreed, but one copy was hand-maintained

Each now has exactly one implementation in `src/quantities.py`. Every test
below is written to FAIL if a second definition reappears — either
behaviourally (two real call sites stop agreeing) or structurally (the
arithmetic is retyped somewhere it shouldn't be).

The behavioural tests are the load-bearing half: they call the REAL
functions on both sides, so mutating `src/quantities.py` breaks them, and
so does any caller that stops routing through it.

Scope note, stated rather than hidden: the exposure guard covers
`src/risk/rules.py`, `src/api/` and `frontend/src/`. `src/pipeline.py`
still contains its own `sum(market_value * _effective_multiplier(...))`
expressions for pending/projected exposure; those are part of the separate
"how invested is the book" unification and are deliberately out of scope
here rather than silently excluded.
