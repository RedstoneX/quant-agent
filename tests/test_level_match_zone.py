"""The "is this stop AT that level" tolerance is the level zone's OWN width.

docs/WORK.md item 46, fixed 2026-09-13. These tests exist to stop one
specific class of regression: a tolerance expressed in one unit drifting
away from the thing it claims to cover, expressed in another.

WHAT WENT WRONG. `risk.level_match_atr_tolerance` was `0.25`, i.e. a stop
counted as sitting AT a computed level if it was within 0.25 ATR of it, and
its config comment justified 0.25 by saying a computed level is a ZONE
(`find_structural_levels` clusters pivots within `CLUSTER_TOLERANCE_PCT` =
1% of price into one level) and that the tolerance therefore had to be "at
least that wide". Those are different units, so the justification was never
a statement about the setting — it was a statement about the instrument:

    0.25 * ATR >= 0.01 * price   <=>   ATR >= 4.0% of price

The claim only held on names whose ATR is at least 4% of price. Every
quieter name got a tolerance NARROWER than the zone, so a stop sitting
inside a level's real zone was not recognised as level-backed, was widened
to the ATR band instead, and the trade's reward:risk was judged against a
stop that had moved off the structure it was placed on (item 1's geometry).

THE FIX, AND WHY IT IS NOT ANOTHER NUMBER. No ATR multiple can be correct
here, because the ratio between an ATR multiple and a percentage of price
is a different number for every name on every day. So the constant is gone
rather than re-tuned: the match tolerance is read from
`src.data.levels.level_zone_halfwidth`, which derives it from the very
`CLUSTER_TOLERANCE_PCT` that built the zone. One number, one unit, one
file. `test_no_atr_multiple_survives_anywhere` is the mechanical guard.

The ATR question was not deleted, it was put back where it belongs: whether
a stop is far enough out to survive the name's noise is still
`min_stop_atr_multiple` / `absolute_min_stop_atr_multiple`, and whether a
level has BROKEN is `BREAK_CONFIRMATION_ATR_MULTIPLE`. Both are genuinely
volatility questions. "Which level is this stop on" is an identity question
about a zone, and is answered in the zone's unit.
