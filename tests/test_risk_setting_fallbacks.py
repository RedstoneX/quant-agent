"""Every `_risk_setting` fallback must equal the value the desk trades on.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`TradingPipeline.__init__` wires the constructor's risk inputs with
`_risk_setting("<field>", <literal>)`. The literal is used when the
configured value is absent or is not a real number, and `_risk_setting`'s
own docstring calls it "the ratified default". Nothing enforced that.

On 2026-09-30 (board item 90) exactly one of the fifteen disagreed:
`min_stop_atr_multiple` fell back to 1.5 while the desk trades 2.5.

HOW THE 1.5 GOT THERE — read from git, not inferred
---------------------------------------------------
Commit `0088328c` (PR #269, 2026-09-10) is a SQUASH of three sub-commits.
The first re-derived the stop floor 3.0 -> 1.5 and correctly moved this
fallback 3.0 -> 1.5 with it. The second moved the base 1.5 -> 2.5 in
`config/settings.yaml` and `src/config.py` and did not move the fallback.
So this is a half-landed second sub-commit — precisely the failure
`scripts/definition_of_done.py` was built for ("the half in front of the
author got fixed") — and NOT, as was briefly supposed, a transcription
slip from the neighbouring `min_reward_risk_after_widening", 1.5` line.
The diff shows the deliberate matched 3.0 -> 1.5 edit in sub-commit one.

Note also what `config/settings.yaml` never held: the deployed value went
3.0 -> 2.5 and was never 1.5. `git log --all -S'min_stop_atr_multiple: 1.5'
-- config/settings.yaml` returns nothing. The 1.5 era existed only inside
PR #269's branch.

WHAT THIS CLAIMS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
--------------------------------------
The 1.5 was NOT reachable on the production path: a real `RiskConfig`
always carries the attribute and pydantic coerces the deployed YAML.
Measured 2026-09-30: the three test modules that construct a
`TradingPipeline` (`test_pipeline`, `test_agent_log_attribution`,
`test_credential_outage_fail_closed`) give 108 passed with the fallback at
either 1.5 or 2.5, so no test outcome depended on it either. It is a stale
constant, not a live defect, and it is written down that way rather than
oversold.

WHY NOT THE LEDGER GATE
-----------------------
`src/number_sources.py` names "fallback arguments (`_risk_number(x, 25.0)`,
`kwargs.get(k, 25.0)`)" among the shapes it structurally cannot scan, and
suggests hoisting each literal to a named constant — which would work but
would add a ledger row, and therefore a new number to account for, per
fallback. Pinning each fallback to the deployed value closes the same hole
and introduces no number: every assertion here is an equality between two
things already in the tree.

THREE THINGS THIS CHECKS THAT AN EARLIER DRAFT DID NOT
------------------------------------------------------
1. It compares against `config/settings.yaml`, the file the desk actually
   trades, falling back to the `RiskConfig` field default only where the
   YAML does not carry the key. Comparing two code defaults to each other
   would have passed while the deployed value diverged from both.
2. The expected field list is an EQUALITY, not `len(...) >= 10`. A wiring
   line that disappears fails here instead of silently shrinking coverage.
3. The scan resolves a fallback written as a NAME as well as one written
   as a bare numeric literal, so hoisting a literal to a constant cannot
   make it invisible to this test.

def _scan_fallbacks() -> dict[str, float]:
    """`{field: fallback}` for every `_risk_setting(...)` call in the file.

    An AST walk rather than a regex, so a fallback hoisted to a named
    module constant resolves to its value instead of vanishing. The constant
    may live in src/pipeline.py or be IMPORTED from another module: board
    item 216 (2026-10-01) collapsed the short-side gap haircut to a single
    definition in `src.risk.constants`, so the wiring line now reads
    `_risk_setting("max_gross_exposure_x", MAX_GROSS_EXPOSURE_X_DEFAULT)`
    with the number defined one import away. Following the import is the
    right answer: restoring a literal here to keep the scanner happy would
    recreate exactly the duplicate definition that item was closed to remove,
    and the fallback stays genuinely checked against the deployed value.
