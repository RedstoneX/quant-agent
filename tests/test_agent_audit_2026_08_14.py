"""Regression guards for the deferred half of the 2026-08-13 adversarial
agent audit.

`tests/test_prompt_audit_2026_08_13.py` landed the text-only findings and
explicitly held five back as "behaviour or data flow, needs external
architectural review". This file covers those five, now implemented:

  F4  premortem / observability — a mandatory audit step could vanish with
      no parse error, no log line and no reader.
  F5  PM / Risk independence — RM read PM's case for the plan before it saw
      a single primary number.
  F6  risk evidence completeness — RM's prompt made it the enforcer of two
      rules whose inputs never reached it.
  F7b earnings valuation data — decided NOT to route price data in; the
      guards here pin the decision and detect the claims it forbids.
  F8  inherited long bias — three behavioural priors fitted to one window
      of one account, stated as standing truths.

Every test names the finding it pins so a later editor — human, or the
meta_reflector's auto-evolve path — sees what breaks before removing it.

What is deliberately NOT here, because nothing changed: every deterministic
threshold, the veto/modification hierarchy, the schema optionality of
`continuity_check` / `premortem_check`, and Alpaca paper-only. Tests below
assert several of those are still intact.
