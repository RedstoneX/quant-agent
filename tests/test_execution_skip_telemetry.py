"""Execution-phase BUY skips must leave durable evidence.

2026-08-19 production forensics: three risk-approved BUYs (XLE/XLF/XLI)
were skipped as unfunded on log-only `continue` statements. The DB showed
no trace, the funnel displayed `proposed_not_executed` with no reason, the
run reported status='executed' with zero orders, and the evening analyst
graded the day as a deliberate no-trade ("need more proactive idea
generation"). Every deterministic skip now appends to ctx.execution_skips
and persists an `execution_skip` evidence row; a morning whose approved
BUYs ALL died on the funding race reports terminal `buys_unfunded` without
automatically purchasing another full decision chain.
