stopped 10% away risks 0.3% of equity, the same 3% stopped 2% away risks

the number that does (the stop distance) was set by the technical analyst.

# §12.1 — a stop at a VERIFIED structural level is honoured, however tight
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The defect: `min_stop_atr_multiple` OVERWROTE the level-derived stop
# whenever the level sat closer to entry than the band. The stop then pointed
# at nothing real, and `min_reward_risk_after_widening` was judged against
# that fabricated number. Over a ~15-session hold a stock travels ~3.9 ATR,
# so against a 3.0-ATR stop the best achievable ratio is ~1.29 against a 1.5
# floor — essentially no trade could pass. On 2026-09-01 the desk reviewed 38
# qualified signals and placed ZERO trades.
#
# "Verified" means the price came out of `find_structural_levels` and was
# attached to the analysis IN PYTHON (`computed_levels`). A level the MODEL
# asserts earns nothing — otherwise a model could buy itself an exemption
# from the noise floor by naming a number beside its stop.
#
# --- GEOMETRY REWORKED 2026-09-10, when the base floor went 1.5 -> 2.5 -----
#
# (It was reworked once before, on 2026-09-04, when the base went 3.0 -> 1.5.
# Both reworks were done the same way: every number below re-derived by hand
# from the new settings, never search-and-replaced and never copied out of a
# pytest failure message.)
#
# Shared geometry: entry $100.00, ATR $2.35, a "range" setup, so the multiple
# is 2.5 base x 0.90 (range) = 2.25 ATRs and:
#
#   band distance   2.25 x 2.35 = $5.2875  ->  band edge  $94.7125 -> $94.71
#   absolute floor  1.00 x 2.35 = $2.35    ->  hard floor $97.65   (unchanged)
#   match tolerance 0.25 x 2.35 = $0.5875                          (unchanged)
#
# THE TIGHT-STOP FIXTURE MOVED AGAIN, for the same structural reason it moved
# in 2026-09-04's rework, only in the opposite direction. The exemption
# window — the band of stop distances where being level-backed is the ONLY
# thing that decides the outcome — is [1.00, 2.25] ATRs now, i.e. $94.7125 to
# $97.65 in price terms. It was [1.00, 1.35] ATRs ($96.83 to $97.65) while the
# base was 1.5, and [1.00, 3.45] before that. So the window did not move away
# from the old $97.00 fixture; it grew, and $97.00 (1.28 ATRs) is still inside
# it. The fixture moves anyway, and the reason is the reward:risk straddle
# below rather than the band membership:
#
#   $97.00 is $3.00 of risk; the band stop is $5.2875 of risk. To make the
#   unbacked twin FAIL the 1.5 floor the reward must be under 1.5 x 5.2875 =
#   $7.93125, and to make the level-backed twin PASS it must be at least
#   1.5 x 3.00 = $4.50. That interval is $4.50–$7.93 wide, so the pair would
#   still straddle — but at a reward of, say, $4.60 the unbacked case scores
#   0.8700 and the level-backed case 1.5333, which is no longer a straddle of
#   the floor, it is one number nowhere near it. The test's whole point is
#   that the ONLY difference between the two is which stop was divided by, so
#   both ratios have to sit close to the floor on either side of it.
#
# The fixture is therefore $95.00 — $5.00 out, 5.00 / 2.35 = 2.1277 ATRs,
# inside the 2.25 band and well outside the 1.00 hard floor — with the
# derived target at $107.85 ($7.85 of reward). Worked by hand:
#
#   level-backed:  reward 7.85 / risk 5.0000  = 1.5700  -> clears 1.5, ships
#   unbacked:      reward 7.85 / risk 5.2875  = 1.4846  -> under 1.5, refused
#
#   (7.85 / 5.0000 = 1.57 exactly. 7.85 / 5.2875: 5.2875 x 1.48 = 7.8255 and
#    5.2875 x 1.4846 = 7.849714, so the quotient is 1.484633... -> 1.4846.)
#
# Those two straddle the floor deliberately — 0.07 above it and 0.015 below —
# exactly as the old $97.00/$104.60 pair straddled it at 1.5333/1.4500. The
# ONLY difference between them is which stop the division was done on, which
# is the whole of §12.1.

    """SLB, 2026-09-01 morning run: `strong_buy` / `high` conviction, entry
    $60.10, and a shipped stop of $55.50 — 7.7% — that scored reward:risk
    1.28 against a geometric maximum of ~1.29, so it was refused before
    anyone judged the trade.

    shipped $55.50 stop is exactly 3.45 ATRs out (the 3.0 base x 1.15 for a
    range setup), which back-solves ATR = $1.3333. The analyst's own stop is

        part: between 2026-09-04 and 2026-09-10 this test was called
        `..._leaves_slbs_own_stop_alone_without_any_level` and asserted
        exactly that, which a 2.25-ATR band makes false.

        The history, in one place:
          * base 3.0 (range scaler 1.15) — band 3.45 ATRs. The analyst's
            $57.83 stop was overwritten with a fabricated $55.50 and the
            trade died at R/R 1.28. That is the 2026-09-01 refusal.
          * base 1.5 (scaler 0.90) — band 1.35 ATRs = $1.80, edge $58.30.
            The analyst's stop at 1.70 ATRs was OUTSIDE the band, untouched,
            and shipped at its own geometry, R/R 2.59.
          * base 2.5 (scaler 0.90) — band 2.25 ATRs, i.e. this test. The
            analyst's stop is inside the band again and IS widened. What
            has changed since the 3.0 base is that the widened stop is no
            longer fatal: the trade still clears the reward:risk floor.

        Worked by hand:
          band distance   2.25 x 1.33333 = $3.00   -> band edge $57.10
          analyst's stop  60.10 - 57.83  = $2.27   = 1.70 ATR, tighter,
                                                     so it is widened
          shipped risk    60.10 - 57.10  = $3.00
          reward:risk     (65.99 - 60.10) / 3.00   = 5.89 / 3.00 = 1.9633
                                                   -> 1.96, clears 1.5
          (against the old 3.45-ATR band the same reward over $4.60 of risk
           was 1.28, which is the refusal.)
