"""Spec §9.4 — agreement REFUSES a trade; it does not size one.

The SIGNED score over the independent seats (of technical/news/earnings/
macro/smart_money) — those aligned with the target's proposed action MINUS
those opposed to it — is computed deterministically from the canonical
evidence registry (reusing `validate_grounding`'s own polarity rule, not a
second one) and turned into ONE yes/no decision in `PortfolioConstructor`:
at or below zero the target is refused outright and produces no order; at
+1 or more it carries no size restriction of its own.

**The graduated ceiling was retired 2026-09-14 by owner decision.** It
scaled permitted risk as `max_position_risk_pct x sqrt(net / 5 seats)`; the
square-root law prices INDEPENDENT estimates, and these five seats read
overlapping evidence with several sharing one underlying model, so its one
precondition was never met. Measured over the archived sized targets of the
2026-08-28..2026-09-02 snapshot, the rungs capped ZERO targets — only the
refusal ever bit. `test_no_agreement_keyed_size_ladder_exists` fails if any
per-score size ladder comes back.

The signed sum landed 2026-09-02. `tests/test_signed_dissent.py` holds the
acceptance criterion for that change and the mechanical pin on seat weights;
this file is the rule's own behaviour, end to end.
