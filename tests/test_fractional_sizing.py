"""Spec §11.1 — fractional shares are ON, and the three guards that let them be.

WHAT THIS PINS

Whole-share rounding is a silent, constant tax on every position this desk
opens: the ratified example is a 6% target that arrived as 3.84% of the book.
`test_whole_share_rounding_tax_is_the_thing_being_removed` reproduces exactly
that arithmetic and fails if flooring ever comes back.

Turning it on is only acceptable because three guards bound the one real
risk — that the protective stop, which is now a SEPARATE order placed after
the fill, never lands at all:

  guard 1  the stop retries IMMEDIATELY and hard, in the same call
  guard 2  a stop that still fails ALERTS THE OWNER, not a log line
  guard 3  the 30-minute sweep reports NO STOP AT ALL as a different and
           worse condition than STOP PRESENT BUT MIS-SIZED

and because eligibility FAILS CLOSED: a symbol is sized fractionally only
when the broker itself confirms `fractionable`. Unknown, unreadable or
un-askable all mean whole shares. Fractional-by-assumption is the state this
must never reach.

HYBRID FRACTIONAL STOPS (section 7, added 2026-09-01) extend those three
guards rather than replacing them. The broker was probed against the live
paper account: it refuses a fractional GTC order outright and accepts a
fractional DAY one. So a fractional position is covered by TWO orders — a
durable GTC stop over the whole shares and a DAY stop over the sub-share
remainder — and the DAY stop lapses at every close by design.

That makes the ALERTING the load-bearing part, not the placement. A lapsed
overnight DAY stop is expected and must stay silent; the same stop missing
during market hours, or a missing whole-share GTC leg at any hour, must
still alert. Section 7 pins all three from both sides — including the case
that must alert, so the suppression cannot degrade into "never alert about
fractional".

# 7. Spec §11.1 HYBRID FRACTIONAL STOPS — the whole/fractional split, the
#    re-placement path, and THE ALERTING DISTINCTION.
#
# The broker was probed against the live paper account on 2026-09-01:
#   * a fractional GTC order is refused ("fractional orders must be DAY
#     orders", 42210000); a fractional TRAILING stop is refused at any tif;
#   * STOP/DAY, STOP_LIMIT/DAY and LIMIT/DAY are accepted fractional;
#   * whole-share GTC stops are unaffected.
#
# So a sub-share remainder cannot carry a durable stop, and its DAY stop
# lapses every night by design. The single most important property of this
# feature is therefore NOT that the stop gets placed — it is that the
# alerting can tell an expected nightly lapse apart from a real failure. An
# alert that fires every night on a healthy system is worse than no alert:
# it trains the owner to swipe away the one message that must never be
# ignored. These tests pin that distinction from both sides.
