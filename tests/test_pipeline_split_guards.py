"""Step-0 guards for the pipeline split (board item 210, docs/PIPELINE_SPLIT_PLAN.md).

Three things are guarded here and nothing is moved:

1. The DUPLICATE-METHOD guard (`scripts/pipeline_method_guard.py`). A method
   defined on two of TradingPipeline and its mixins is compared against
   `origin/main` at check time; nothing is stored.
2. The LEDGER-ID / `SCOPED_PATHS` MIGRATION HELPER (`src/ledger_move.py`),
   exercised on a SYNTHETIC move against copies of the real files, so the
   helper is proved to rewrite ids rather than merely to exist.

3. THE COMPATIBILITY SHIMS. A name re-exported from `src/pipeline.py` purely
   so old importers keep working is imported there and used nowhere there, so
   `patch("src.pipeline.<name>")` rebinds an unused alias and intercepts
   nothing while the test still passes. No test may patch such a name.

All three guards are themselves proved to be able to fail: the inventory check
is run against mutated source text with a method added, removed and renamed,
the verifier is run against a deliberately half-applied move, and the shim
check is run against a synthetic patch of a real re-exported name.

# 3. COMPATIBILITY SHIMS MUST NOT BECOME SILENT PATCH TARGETS.
#
# Each split step re-exports the names it moved from `src/pipeline.py` so that
# existing importers keep working. Those names are imported there and never
# used there. A test that writes `patch("src.pipeline.<name>", ...)` against
# such a name still SUCCEEDS -- it rebinds the old module's unused alias -- but
# it intercepts nothing, because the moved code resolves the name in its own
# module. The test then passes while testing nothing.
#
# WHICH CHECK THIS IS: the second of the two options -- no test may patch a
# name on `src.pipeline` that `src.pipeline` itself no longer uses.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT CATCH:
#   * a patch target built at runtime from pieces, or passed as a variable,
#     rather than written as a literal `src.pipeline.<name>` in the test text;
#   * `patch.object(pipeline_module, "name")`, which never spells the dotted
#     path;
#   * a name used by `src/pipeline.py` only inside a string annotation, which
#     this reads as unused and would therefore flag (a false alarm, not a
#     miss -- it fails loudly rather than quietly).
