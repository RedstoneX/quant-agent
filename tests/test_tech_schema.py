"""Item 157 (docs/WORK.md; from #538's write-up): the technical seat now
declares a `result_model` (`TechAnalystAnswer`) and sends a strict schema on
both routes. WHAT THIS ACTUALLY BUYS TODAY, honestly stated: pydantic still
validates every row exactly as before (a semantically-invalid row is caught
at construction, same as pre-existing behaviour), and the wrapper lets the
#538 per-row salvage keep working after unwrapping `results`. What it does
NOT yet buy — because it has never been confirmed live (see
tests/test_tech_schema_live.py) — is a provider that refuses to emit a
malformed row IN THE FIRST PLACE via constrained decoding; that half of
item 157 stays open on the board. This file covers the new pieces:

  - `TechAnalystAnswerItem` carries only what the model fills in — the eight
    desk-filled (Python-set) fields from `TechAnalysisResult` are absent.
  - `TechAnalystAnswer` is the wrapper object (`{"results": [...]}`) sent as
    the schema root, since a strict json_schema response format requires an
    object, not the seat's old bare list.
  - `_response_format_for(TechAnalystAnswer)` — verified, not assumed — comes
    out strict=true: excluding the eight desk-filled fields also excludes
    `computed_level_touches`, the one free-form map that used to force
    strict=false on the old (unused) full-model schema.
  - `AgentResult.parse_json_rows(list_field="results")` unwraps the wrapper
    before the existing #538 per-row salvage runs, and still accepts a bare
    list (a legacy stored answer, or a route that ignores the schema) so
    nothing that worked before regresses.
  - The old "one malformed row costs only itself" scenario, replayed under
    the NEW wrapper-object answer shape.
