"""Item 55: a level is a band the BARS drew, not a percentage of price.

The old rule chained a pivot into a level when its PRICE sat within a flat
1% of the group's anchor. These pin the replacement: two pivots are the same
level when the price ranges their bars actually traded overlap, the level's
zone is those bars' own combined span, and a level with no recorded zone
falls back to the old percentage rather than losing its zone entirely.
