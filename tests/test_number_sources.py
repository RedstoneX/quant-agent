"""The gate. A new trade-governing number with no source fails the build.

`pytest` is the check branch protection requires, so this file — not a
reporting script somebody runs by hand — is what makes the no-arbitrary-numbers
rule mechanical. Read `src/number_sources.py`'s docstring for the scope rule
and for the honest list of what this cannot catch.

The tests below are in two groups. The first is the gate itself, against the
live tree. The second proves each failure mode actually fires, using synthetic
fixtures — because a gate nobody has seen fail is indistinguishable from a
gate that passes everything, which is how the desk's `Adversary:` check became
theatre once already.

A standing caution, because it has already happened here: every rule in this
file tests that a justification EXISTS in an openable shape. None of them
tests that one is TRUE. The first version of this ledger's flagship entry was
false in four places and passed every test below.
