"""docs/WORK.md item 88 — a stop of zero is a REFUSAL, never an absence.

`0.0` was this codebase's sentinel for "no stop", so a garbage or
miscomputed stop of zero removed protection instead of refusing the
trade. These are the guards on the four places a stop VALUE is acted on,
and nothing else: the entry submit, the shared protective-stop placement,
the coverage-repair janitor, and the partial-exit reprotect (whose
`return True` on a zero made the drain DELETE the recovery intent).

The one legitimate absence — `stop_loss_price=None`, the cash-sweep park's
deliberate stopless buy — is pinned here too, because a fix that refused
absence as well would have broken it.
