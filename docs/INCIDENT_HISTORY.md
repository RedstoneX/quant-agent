# QAMC Incident History

**What this file is:** a permanent, plain-language record of things that broke
and what was done about them. Newest first.

**Why it exists separately from `docs/WORK.md`.** WORK.md is the active
backlog and it has a hard 100,000-byte cap, so finished incidents get trimmed
out of it as new work arrives — which means the history of what went wrong
was being deleted by design. Git kept it, but git is not readable by the
owner. Rex asked for a record that does not disappear. This is it.

**Rules for this file.** Append, never trim. Never delete an entry to save
space; if it gets long, split by year. Every entry leads with one
non-technical line stating what actually broke in ordinary words, because the
person who most needs to read this is not a developer. Detail goes underneath
for whoever has to fix it again.

**Never record here what the repo already records** — no restating code, no
commit IDs as the substance of an entry. Record the *reasoning*: what the
symptom was, what the real cause turned out to be, what was ruled out, and
what would catch it next time.

### 2026-09-18 — the desk could say it refused every idea, but never why (item 119)

**In plain words.** The owner got an alarm saying the desk had turned down
every idea it looked at, two sessions running, for one unchanging reason.
The alarm was right to fire. The trouble was the reason it printed:
`portfolio_manager|omitted|candidate_not_selected_for_target||`. That is not
a reason. It is what the desk wrote down when the portfolio manager simply
did not pick a name — and nobody had ever asked the portfolio manager why.
Because the manager was never asked, every candidate it dropped got the same
non-answer, in every session, forever.

**Why that mattered more than it looks.** The whole point of that alarm is
to tell a JAMMED gate apart from a QUIET MARKET. The test is shape, not
count: a quiet market kills different names for different reasons, and a
jammed gate kills every name for the same one. With exactly one reason
available to it, the alarm could never observe anything else. Every empty
day looked like a jam and every jam looked like an empty day. An alarm that
can only say one thing is not a diagnosis; it is a light that is always on.

**What was ruled out.** The obvious read — "the gate really is jammed, go
find it" — was the wrong job. The likely cause of the 2026-09-17 jam had
already been fixed overnight: the manager had been told the account had no
margin while margin was enabled, and separately told it was over a
fully-invested mandate while the book was deliberately levered above it.
Both were prompt falsehoods, both were corrected before this work started,
and both were confirmed on the main branch rather than taken on trust. So
the task was never to unjam anything. It was to make sure the NEXT jam can
be named.

**What was actually wrong, and the fix.** The manager was asked to produce
targets and nothing else, and the code then inferred a refusal from the
silence. Inferring is the defect: silence carries no information, so there
was nothing to record but the fact of the silence itself. The manager is now
required to account for every candidate it was shown — either it is a
target, or it is a rejection carrying a named ground from a fixed vocabulary
plus a sentence of the manager's own. When it still says nothing, the desk
does not quietly write the silence down as though it were a fact about the
stock. It follows the same order it already follows for a lost research seat
and for an unsubstantiated exit: repair mechanically from what the seat DID
say, ask once more under the retry budget that already exists, and only then
record, per name, that the seat would not account for it — which is a fact
about the desk, and reads as one.

**Two things that were easy to get wrong here and were deliberately not
done.** The re-ask asks for bookkeeping only and its answer is thrown away
except for the missing explanations; if a paid retry could revise the plan,
every accounting gap would become a chance to re-trade the book. And the
manager's own prose is deliberately kept OUT of the field the alarm compares
sessions on. Prose varies with wording where the cause is identical, so
comparing on prose would make a genuine jam invisible whenever the model
happened to phrase itself differently twice. The named ground is what gets
compared; the sentence is what the owner reads.

**Why this cannot make the alarm cry wolf.** Before, every candidate
produced the same single key, so any session with no entries was
automatically "one unvarying reason". Now a session only looks that way when
its candidates really did die on the same named ground. More distinct
reasons can only split that set and shorten a run — the alarm can get
rarer, never more frequent. That direction was checked explicitly rather
than assumed.

**Note for anyone reading older entries.** The worked example under item 59
elsewhere in this file quotes
`portfolio_manager / omitted / candidate_not_selected_for_target` as the
terminal record for five real candidates. That was true when it was written.
That outcome no longer exists; the same situation now records a named ground
or an explicit "the seat would not say".

**What would have caught it earlier.** Nothing in the code was broken — it
did exactly what it was written to do. What was missing was anyone asking
whether the thing being recorded was INFORMATION. A durable per-symbol
record whose value is constant across every symbol and every session cannot
answer a question, and that is checkable by looking at it rather than by
waiting for an alarm to fire uselessly.

### 2026-09-17 — the desk could never have been told its own fills

**In plain words:** the desk places orders through a service that quietly swaps
in the real trading password on the way out, so ordering works even though the
desk itself only holds a fake one. But the separate live feed that tells it
"your order just filled" does not go through that service and has to present the
password itself. It was presenting the fake one. That feed has never once worked,
and could not have.

**Cause.** Two independent blockers, either of which alone is fatal. The broker
authenticates that feed with a message sent *inside* the connection, not with a
header on the way in — and the swap-in service only rewrites headers, so there
was nothing for it to rewrite. Separately, the library the feed is built on is an
older implementation that cannot be routed through that service at all. So the
feed could not be fixed by pointing it at the same plumbing everything else uses.

**Why it went unnoticed for so long.** Because the ordering path kept working. A
fake password that still places orders looks exactly like a healthy desk from
the outside, and nothing said at startup which password the process was actually
holding. Eight days passed, and five separate attempts went into tuning *when*
the feed connected — optimising the timing of a handshake that was never going
to succeed with the credential it was presenting. Every one of those attempts
was reasoning about the wrong layer, and nothing in the system was positioned to
say so.

**Fix.** Since the feed must hold the real password, it is now delivered to the
process as a locked-down file handed over by the system at startup, instead of
sitting in the plain-text settings file with everything else. It never enters the
process's environment, so it is not visible in the places a running process
normally leaks its settings, and it is not in the code checkout, so no deploy can
move or expose it. The fake password stays exactly where it is and is simply
outranked. Every start now says, in the log, where each trading credential came
from and how long it is — never what it is — and, if it is holding an obvious
stand-in, pushes ONE Telegram message naming every affected credential, at most
ONCE A DAY while that stays true.

**Why the alert is rationed, which was a correction on this change.** The first
version alerted once per problem, per start. `main.py --mode <session>` is the
entrypoint for all six session units and both broker credentials are
placeholders today, so that was roughly a dozen identical messages a day,
indefinitely, about a condition that is the known intended state while the
live-fill socket is off. That is the same mistake twice over: the
fill-degradation alert was deliberately shipped NOT firing on the socket being
off, precisely because paging on an intended configuration only moves the noise
into Telegram — and the eight-day placeholder above went unnoticed BECAUSE
roughly 150 daily auth failures had already made that channel unreadable. A
placeholder credential is a standing configuration state, not an event; it
changes only when a human changes it. So the honest cadence is the coarsest one
that still re-states the condition while it is live. The log line is unchanged
and still written on every single start; only the push is rationed, on the same
once-a-day marker shape the coverage and silence watchdogs already use.

**And the stand-in word list is matched on word boundaries, not raw substrings.**
A real key is an opaque run of characters, and "todo", "insert" and "xxxx" can
all turn up inside one by chance — at which point the desk would have shouted
"placeholder" about a working credential. It could never have blocked anything,
but an unmeasured false-positive word list sitting in an alert path is exactly
how alerts stop being read. No length or prefix rule was added; Alpaca documents
neither, and inventing one would start rejecting real keys the day the issuing
format changed.

**What was ruled out.** Encrypting the credential at rest, which was the
original intent. The desk's services run under the unprivileged account's own
service manager, and unlocking an encrypted credential requires reading a
system file only the administrator can read, so the service dies before the
application starts. There is also no security chip on this machine to fall back
on. This was reproduced with a fake value rather than assumed. The result is a
credential protected by file permissions, not by cryptography — a real
improvement on a shared plain-text file, but a smaller one than intended, and it
is recorded as such rather than overstated. Encryption becomes possible only if
the services are moved to the administrator's service manager, which is a
separate decision. Also ruled out: reviving the custom credential proxy that was
rejected earlier — nothing here adds one.

**Also ruled out: guessing whether a credential is real from its shape.** The
broker does not publish what its keys look like, so any length or prefix rule
would be a number invented to look careful, and would start rejecting genuine
keys the day the broker changed its format. The check instead fires only on
positive evidence someone typed a stand-in. It therefore cannot catch a
wrong-but-plausible key, which is stated openly rather than papered over.

**What would catch it next time.** The startup line naming the source and length
of each trading credential, and the alert on a stand-in, both of which would have
fired on day one of the eight. But the real lesson is narrower: a credential is
not proven by anything the desk says about itself. The acceptance test for this
change is a single observation that the broker *accepted* the credential on the
live feed — a statement made by the other side. The feed stays switched off until
that observation exists. Nobody demanded that existence proof for eight days, and
that, not the credential, is what actually failed.

### 2026-09-18 — a stop price of zero switched protection OFF instead of refusing the trade (item 88 closed)

**In plain words.** The desk used the number zero to mean "this position was
never given a stop". So whenever a stop came out as zero by accident — a
miscalculation, a corrupted saved level, a bad number from a model — the
system did not say "that is wrong, refuse the trade". It read it as "this one
is not supposed to have a stop" and carried on with nothing protecting the
position. The one thing a risk control must never do is fail in the direction
of less protection, and this did exactly that.

**Where it was real, and where it was not.** Three lanes were untraced when
this was filed. Traced against the code, not the docstrings:

* **The coverage-repair janitor — genuinely exposed, and worse than failing
  open.** The thing whose entire job is to close protection gaps REFUSED to
  act on a recorded stop of zero, and reported that refusal as the same fact
  as "this row never had a stop". So a position could be permanently
  unrepairable, and the owner alert that eventually fired said only that "the
  automatic repair could not restore one" — identical wording for a corrupt
  saved level, a level the price had already passed, and three exhausted
  broker retries. Three different states, three different owner actions, one
  sentence. Worse, the refusal only reaches the owner at all when coverage is
  *exactly zero*; a partly-covered position carried it no further than a log
  file.
* **The partial-exit reprotect — a genuine fail-open, found while tracing.**
  After a partial sale the residual shares are re-protected using the most
  protective of the stops that were cancelled to make the sale possible. If
  none of those carried a usable price, the function returned **success**. The
  caller reads success as "coverage rebuilt" and DELETES the saved recovery
  intent — so the residual position was left naked with nothing left to retry
  it, and nothing said so. A missing (rather than zero) price would instead
  crash the comparison.
* **The position-resume / write-ahead lanes — not exposed.** They already
  refused a non-positive stop and kept the recovery row alive. They did pass a
  recorded infinity straight through to the broker, which is not a price
  either; closed here.
* **The live entry lane — safe, but for a reason nobody should rely on.** The
  entry call site converted a zero into "no stop supplied" *before* the broker
  could judge it, which is the laundering at the heart of this item. Nothing
  live reached it only because a zero stop on an entry is separately hard-
  blocked by the `require_stop_loss` risk rule, i.e. by a setting that happens
  to be switched on. The order edge now fails closed on its own.

**What the fix actually is: the distinction, not another threshold.** "No stop
was requested" and "a stop was requested and its value is garbage" are
different facts with opposite correct responses, and every one of these lanes
had collapsed them into one. Exactly one path is legitimately stopless — the
cash-sweep park, which passes no stop at all and says so — and it still works.
Everything else now refuses zero, negative, NaN and infinity loudly, at the
order edge, and keeps the gap flagged instead of reporting it as covered. The
repair janitor now hands its caller the REASON it declined, which the owner
alert and the standalone coverage watchdog both render instead of guessing.

**What would have caught it.** Nothing, and that is the point: the sentinel was
documented, deliberate and explicitly left in place by an earlier pass (the
NaN half of the same hole was closed on the entry lane only). A test asserted
the defect as correct behaviour. The lesson is the one already in
`docs/OUTCOME.md`: a value that means "absent" must never be a value the
arithmetic can also produce.

**Deliberately NOT changed.** `TradeDecision` still accepts `stop_loss=0` on a
BUY/SHORT — that is what lets the `require_stop_loss` rule be tested at all,
and the refusal now lives at the order edge where it fails closed for every
producer rather than at one model's validator.

### 2026-09-17 — the desk was paying a model to read a description of a safety net it had deleted three days earlier

**In plain words:** when anything had automatically sold a position earlier in the day, the seat that reviews open positions was handed a note explaining why. That note said the desk performs an "emergency sell-all" when the day's loss passes 3%. Neither half had been true since 14 September: the sell-all was deleted and replaced by a stop-everything-and-check-the-stops halt that sells nothing, and the 3% figure had already been replaced by a limit measured from how much the book itself moves on an ordinary day. So a paid seat was reasoning about the desk's own emergency behaviour from a description that was two changes out of date, on exactly the days something had already gone wrong.

**Cause — and it is not "someone forgot".** The change that deleted the sell-all shipped a full documentation pass: the backlog, the board notes and this file were all updated in the same commit. It touched no prompt. That is not an oversight by one person, it is a gap in what the word "documentation" points at here: `AGENTS.md` names three tiers of document, and the prompts are in none of them. Nothing in the project's own rules ever said a prompt was a document, so "every substantive change ships with a documentation pass" was satisfied without anyone looking at the text the desk actually pays to have read.

**What was ruled out.** Not neglect of the prompts in general — five prompt files were edited in the three days after the change, including the very one carrying the stale claim. They were edited for other reasons and nothing pointed at the stale sentence. Not an absent mechanism either: a rendering mechanism has existed since 2026-09-11 that makes a numeric limit in a prompt physically unable to disagree with the settings file. It covers two of ten prompt files and, more to the point, it could not have helped: nothing was wrong with a number here. A mechanism described in words stopped existing, and words are not rendered from anything.

**The sharpest finding.** The stale text was not in a prompt FILE. `config/prompts/position_reviewer.md` contains no such claim and never did — the sentence is assembled in Python, in the module that builds the reviewer's message. Any check scoped to the prompt directory would have caught none of it. The surface that matters is prompt markdown AND the Python that assembles prompts, and only the first of those looks like a document.

**Four designs were weighed and three rejected.** Rendering constants into prompts: right for numbers, already exists, extended here to the one hand-typed daily-loss figure it had missed — but blind to this defect. Extracting claims from prompt prose and checking them: nothing can read "the desk performs an emergency sell" and know which function that is. Annotating every behavioural claim with a tie to what it describes: it would have worked, but it asks for maintenance on every sentence forever, and the failure being closed is precisely that nobody remembers the prompts exist. Requiring every number in a prompt to match a named constant: measured at 1,828 numeric tokens across the prompt files — mostly list numbering, dates and figures inside worked examples — it would demand about a thousand annotations and catch neither confirmed case.

**What catches it instead: a check at the deletion site.** Retiring a mechanism now means recording it, in one file, with the WORDS that described it. The build then fails while any prompt, assembled prompt string, docstring or comment still uses those words. Maintenance is asked once, at the moment somebody has the facts open in front of them — the commit that does the deleting — and is free afterwards. Run against the tree as it stood the day before this fix, it finds every stale site, including the two that were live text a model read.

**What it does not catch, said plainly.** A mechanism whose behaviour changes without being deleted: nothing is retired, so nothing is scanned. Drift in a description nobody retired — a threshold that moved, steps reordered, a guarantee quietly weakened. A phrase nobody thought to list. And a retirement nobody records at all, which is a convention and not enforcement; it is a convention placed at the one point in the work where the facts are known, which is the best available trade, not a guarantee.

**One new way to stop the desk, on the record.** The rendering mechanism raises at agent construction time, so a typo in a placeholder halts trading before any capital moves. That is fail-closed and correct, and this change adds two more rendered placeholders. It is also a new way for a settings edit to stop the desk, and the owner should know it exists rather than discover it.

**A third category, worth separating from drift.** Numbers that live only in prompt prose and correspond to nothing in the code: the trade-picking seat's whole sizing arithmetic (its conviction bases, its reward-to-risk bonus, its evening tilt, its stale-signal halving), the technical seat's "three aligned signals for high conviction", its eight-days-to-go-stale rule and its price-to-earnings stretch levels. These are not stale — nothing moved underneath them. They are unsourced numbers hiding where no audit of the code would ever find them, and no check proposed here would see them. Filed as backlog item 107.

### 2026-09-18 — the production checkout now matches what git records (item 94 closed)

The live box was running a hand-built dashboard bundle that had never been committed. Git was not wrong about production in the usual direction — the SERVER was the stale side, since nobody could say from the repo alone what was actually being served. PR #465 rebuilt and committed the cockpit bundle from current frontend source so the two agree, and added a guard that `index.html` may only reference assets that are actually committed, so the drift cannot silently recur. Verified: the dashboard looks no different to the owner — this was a recording fix, not a behaviour change. Item 94 retired.
### 2026-09-18 — the stale-prose problem is not limited to the briefs; the code's own comments are rotting the same way, and two of them were checked

**What broke, in one line:** the desk found seventeen out-of-date statements
in the written briefs given to the trading seats, and then found the same kind
of out-of-date statement inside the code's own comments — so the explanation a
future reader trusts can be describing a rule that was switched off weeks ago.

**The confirmed instance.** `src/portfolio_constructor.py` carries a long
comment reasoning about a "hard reward:risk floor", and works through the
arithmetic of `min_reward_risk_after_widening` as a live constraint a trade
must clear. About two hundred lines above it, the same file states plainly
that nothing in the module refuses a trade on a reward:risk floor any more,
and `src/risk/constants.py` labels the historical key inert. Both cannot be
true. The second is the current one. Nobody is misled into a bad trade by this
— the code does not read the comment — but the next person deriving a stop
width from that arithmetic would be reasoning from a rule that does not exist,
and that is exactly how the brief defects in item 98 were born.

**A second finding in the same comment, worth more than the comment itself.**
The stop-width setup scalers are breakout 1.00 / range 0.90. They were
corrected to those values on 2026-09-04, and the reasoning was recorded
properly at the time: range 0.90 was chosen as *the tightest scaler that keeps
the narrowest reachable stop outside the measured 1.25-ATR noise band*, and
0.85 was explicitly rejected because `1.5 x 0.85 x 0.95 = 1.21` fell back
inside that band. That derivation depended on the base being 1.5. **The base
was changed to 2.5 on 2026-09-10.** At 2.5 the narrowest reachable stop is
`2.5 x 0.90 x 0.95 = 2.14` ATR, nowhere near the noise band — so the
constraint that produced 0.90 rather than 0.85 no longer binds at all. The
number survived; the reason for it did not. It is now effectively an
unsourced constant wearing an old derivation, and it belongs with the rest of
the unsourced trade-governing numbers rather than being treated as settled.
Nothing here says 0.90 is wrong — only that it is no longer derived.

**One thing checked and found FINE, recorded so nobody reopens it.** A
question was raised about whether the exit gate leaves a durable, per-symbol
record when it refuses a sale whose reason names no recognised trigger. It
does. The gate writes a per-symbol, per-run row carrying the status and the
rejected reason text, and separately records the refusal with its own code and
layer. The concern was that the refusal existed only as a log line. It does
not. No work needed.

**A claim that did NOT check out, recorded because a wrong entry is worse than
a missing one.** It was suspected that the setup and regime multipliers had
drifted from what the 2026-09-04 audit recorded with no write-up explaining
why. Half right. They did change — the audit's own table lists setup scalers
of 0.85/1.15, and the live values are 0.90/1.00 — but there IS a full
write-up, in this file under the 2026-09-04 entry, giving the inversion
argument and the derivation of each new value. The regime scalers
(1.20/1.10/0.95) never changed at all. What is genuinely missing is only the
narrower point above: that the 2.5 base silently retired range 0.90's
justification.

**What would catch this class next time.** The same check item 99 argues for,
extended one step: when a mechanism is deleted, grep its symbol name across
the briefs, the assembled strings AND the comments. A comment is the cheapest
place for a deleted rule to keep living, because nothing ever executes it.

### 2026-09-18 — two reconciliation answers were computed and binned, and nobody noticed because a third one next to them was not

**What broke, in one line:** twice every session the desk works out something
worth knowing — which positions the broker closed behind its back, and which
unprotected positions it has just re-protected — and then throws the answer
away before anything can tell the owner.

**The shape of it.** Both routines return a real result: one a list of exits
the broker made unilaterally that the ledger never heard about, the other a
count of protection restores it drained. Every one of the five call sites
calls them as bare statements and keeps nothing. The reason this is a defect
rather than a style choice is sitting on the adjacent line: the third member
of the same family, the stop-coverage audit, has its return captured and
threaded into the session result at every exit point, which is the mechanism
by which a missing stop reaches the owner today. Two of three siblings are
wired up; one pattern was simply never finished.

**Not invisible, and the distinction matters.** Both discarded routines log
what they did, so the information exists in the journal. What it cannot do is
reach a session result, a Telegram message, or any test that reads one. The
honest statement is "unreportable", not "silent" — overstating it would put a
detection gap where there is a reporting gap.

**Found alongside it, older and separate.** A partly-filled order that is
still open never has its filled quantity written down. The fill reconciler
acts only on terminal broker statuses, and a part-fill is not terminal, so
the row stays marked as merely submitted. The code documents that as
deliberate deferral to the next pass, which is sound — except that the same
function documents the case that breaks it: the broker purges order history
after a few days, and an unreconciled row then falls through a
legacy-compatibility filter that treats it as fully filled. A half-filled
order can therefore end up counted as a whole one, taking the cash and
position figures with it. This predates all of tonight's work.

**What would catch it next time.** A test asserting that every reconciliation
routine's result appears in the session result, in the same way the stop
coverage gap already must. The pattern to distrust is a function that returns
a value being called as a statement.

### 2026-09-17 — the live fill feed never once worked, and nobody was told

**In plain words:** when the desk places an order it needs to know whether it actually bought anything. It was built in September to be told the instant a trade happens, over a live connection to the broker. That connection has never worked — not once, in any session, since the day it was built. Everything kept running because the desk also asks the broker over and over the ordinary way, and that has always worked, so no trade was missed and no money was lost. What was lost was a few seconds of every order's waiting time spent on a connection that could never open, and about a hundred and fifty error lines a day in a log the owner does not read.

**Cause.** Two separate, independent reasons, either of which alone is fatal, and neither of which anything in this repository could fix. First, the trading process is not given the real broker keys; it holds placeholders, and a local helper swaps in the real key on ordinary web requests on the way out. That is why placing orders works. The live connection does not go through that helper, and the broker library the desk uses is built on an old networking component that cannot be pointed at one. Second, the broker does not check the key when the connection opens — it checks it in a message sent afterwards, and the local helper only ever rewrites the opening. So even a newer library would have connected and then been refused.

**Decision.** The owner switched the feed off. Fills are confirmed the ordinary way, which is what has actually been confirming them all along. The switch is configuration, not a code change, and flipping it back restores the old behaviour exactly — the code was deliberately left in place, dormant, because the question of whether this process should be given real broker keys was explicitly deferred and is still open.

**What was ruled out.** Any attempt to make the connection authenticate. Both blockers were confirmed before the switch was written, so retrying, reconnecting differently, waiting longer or lengthening the handshake budget were all fixing the wrong thing. Deleting the code was also rejected — the credential decision may revive it, and deleting it would mean rebuilding it from memory.

**The real failure, and it is not the websocket.** A broken thing kept a good fallback, so it looked fine from the outside for a week. That is the hardest kind of breakage to notice, and it is why the switch-off shipped with an alert. The alert fires when fill confirmation genuinely degrades — an order the desk could not get a straight answer about before its window closed, or the half-hourly check finding the desk's own record of what it holds disagreeing with the broker's, with no sale to explain the difference. Both used to reach a log line and nothing else. Neither has anything to do with the feed being off: the feed being off is now the intended setup and deliberately never alerts, because moving a hundred and fifty daily error lines into Telegram would be worse than leaving them in the log.

**What would catch it next time.** Checks that with the feed off no connection is opened and the account's connection slot is never claimed, that the ordinary confirmation path is byte-for-byte the one it always was, that flipping the switch back restores the old path, that an unconfirmed order and a records mismatch each page the owner, and that the feed being off cannot page him. The broader habit: a vendor recommending a mechanism is a reason to build it, never evidence that it runs in this deployment.

### 2026-09-17 — a limit order that never filled turned out to be the market doing its job, not the desk being slow

**In plain words:** about one in eleven trade ideas ended with the order sitting at the broker, the price drifting away before it filled, and the order getting cancelled with the opportunity gone. That looked like a defect worth chasing. Measured against 68 real proposals, it happened 6 times (9%), and every one of those was the market itself walking away from a still-open limit price — not the desk being late.

**Cause.** A separate, real lateness problem existed alongside it: the broker connection used to spend minutes authenticating *after* a trade was already approved, and names still inside the approved price were sometimes lost to that stall. That is now fixed — the connection opens while the reviewer is still working, so the wait no longer stacks on after approval — and it is a distinct cause from an order simply going unfilled because the tape moved.

**What was ruled out.** Re-pegging the order to chase the market after it moves away. The owner decided (2026-09-12) that chasing a worse price is not something this desk should do; a cancelled, unfilled order in a market that moved is the system working as intended, not a bug to patch with a repeg.

**What would catch it next time.** The known-time-budget behaviour already in place: a step that genuinely needs time (such as confirming a funding sale) has that time budgeted explicitly, and if the budget is gone the desk refuses the ticket honestly as "the window closing" rather than sending a stale limit or chasing the price.

---

### 2026-09-17 — the desk could place an order off a price from a day it wasn't trading

**In plain words:** one function answers "what is this worth right now". It asked the broker for the most recent trade and took the answer without ever looking at *when* that trade happened, so on a thinly traded name it could hand back yesterday's price. If there was no trade at all it quietly averaged the buy and sell quotes and returned that, looking exactly the same. Three things that place or move real orders relied on it: the job that puts a missing stop-loss back, the pin that caps what an entry may pay, and the reference a fill is checked against.

**Cause.** Not a regression — original plumbing. The 2026-09-14 fix gave the *research* side the rule that a price must be from today or be labelled stale. The *order* side was never given the same rule, and nothing in between could tell the difference, because the price came back as a bare number with no provenance attached.

**Why it matters most on the stop job.** That job refuses to re-place a stop that would fire the instant it lands — it compares the recorded stop against the live price. Run that comparison against a stale price and it can read "safe" while today's real price is already through the stop, which turns a janitor into an unintended market exit.

**Fix.** The reader now returns the price together with where it came from and two separate freshness answers, because two kinds of caller need different strictness. Stamped-today covers a trade *or* a quote — a live quote mid-session is a legitimate reference for a limit, yesterday's anything is not. A today *print* additionally means the tape really traded there, which is what deciding where a stop belongs requires. An unstamped timestamp fails visible rather than passing as live, the same rule already applied to research snapshots. Stop repair now needs a today print and otherwise leaves the gap flagged for the next sweep, which is what it already does with every other unverifiable input and which the coverage alert already reports. The order path needs today's data and otherwise falls back to the entry the manager and risk reviewer actually approved. Reporting callers — "how far has this moved since we sold it" — keep the bare number and their own last-close fallback; nothing about them changed.

**What was ruled out.** Blocking on a missing print everywhere. Refusing to re-place a stop leaves a position unprotected, so the strict rule is applied only where a wrong price produces a wrong *order*, and the fallback is always a number a human already approved rather than a guess.

**What would catch it next time.** Checks that yesterday's print is not reported as today's, that a quote is never reported as a trade, that a missing timestamp reads as not-today, that the stop job refuses both a stale price and a quote midpoint, and that the entry cap falls back to the approved entry instead of a stale price.

### 2026-09-17 — research reuse said it would expire, then never looked

**In plain words:** the desk was supposed to reuse this morning's research until something real changed — a new headline, a new insider filing, a new economics print — and pay again only then. The expiry checks were wired to helpers that did not exist, so expiry never ran. Economics expiry also compared only the regime name, so a new CPI print under the same "risk-on" label would have been treated as unchanged. A snapshot with no date was treated as "from this session".

**Cause.** The live-wire and Form 4 checks were called through a missing-method lookup that returned "not callable, so nothing changed". That is the same as never checking. The economics check compared the stored regime string to a later snapshot's regime string and ignored the FRED numbers that snapshot was based on. Same-session was `missing date or date is today`, so an undated file counted as today.

**Fix.** The three helpers now exist and read the stores that already hold the evidence: live RSS titles against the remembered report and the raw headline file; Form 4 accessions from the EDGAR listing against the already-processed cache; remembered insider findings from the specialist evidence table plus that cache. Economics expiry compares the actual statistical prints (CPI, unemployment, claims) and their observation dates, not daily market quotes, and those fingerprints are written when a regime is saved. An undated snapshot cannot claim same-session; if it is still a good regime and the prints have not changed, it can be remembered across days. News and Form 4 peeks are scoped to names the desk is watching — a market-wide filing or an unrelated wire is not a change to remembered research, because a false expiry on the midday tick cannot be healed (that tick does not re-pay those seats). A failed peek or a failed FRED fetch is not a change — that would invent churn from an outage. Blank or unreadable answers are still not research.

**What this does not change.** Same-session reuse of a good dated answer stays usable. No second news clock. No seat-count. Spend caps untouched. Paper only.

**What would catch it next time.** Tests that the peek/loaders exist and that a new headline or a new Form 4 accession expires reuse; a test that a new economics print expires reuse even when the regime name is unchanged; a test that an undated snapshot is not same-session; a test that an unchanged dated same-session answer is still reused.

### 2026-09-17 — the midday scan charted only the stocks that jumped, so adding to a quiet holding could throw out the whole plan

**In plain words:** every half hour the desk looks for stocks that have moved a lot and asks the chart seat about those. The trade-picking seat still sees every stock you already own. If it asked to add to a quiet holding — one that had not jumped 3% — the safety check said "there is no chart from this run" and threw away the whole plan, including any new idea that was fully researched. Paying for the decision and then binning it is waste. Dropping the quiet name and keeping the rest would have been skip-and-continue, which is not the product when the missing thing is research the desk should have produced.

**Cause.** The midday chart batch was built from the mover list only. Morning already charts every holding. Midday and morning are separate programs, and the forensic store of those morning charts is not on the trading path, so the midday run could not honestly reuse them as "this run's Technical." Keep-versus-add was already being read off current risk (`_target_intent`, earlier the same day) and was not the remaining hole: a genuine add on a quiet hold still had no chart.

**Fix.** When the midday scan pays for charts because something moved, it also charts the stocks you already own, on the same call. They do not use up the mover slot cap and they do not start the mover cooldown. A quiet day with nothing moving still does not fire a chart call just because you hold names. If a chart still does not come back for a hold, an add is refused — that is fail-closed remainder, not drop-the-name as the product.

**What this does not change.** Fabricating evidence still fails the whole decision. Keep-versus-add is still current risk. Spend caps are untouched. The morning-open research path is untouched.

**What would catch it next time.** A test that a quiet holding is in the midday chart batch next to a mover; a test that holdings do not eat the mover cap; a test that a quiet book with no movers does not pay for charts; a test that an add on a hold grounds once that chart exists, and is still refused if it does not.

**Counts since 2026-09-15.** `agent_logs` / production DB are not on this engineering VM (`qamc` user absent). The one written-up case is `intra_check-44594a05` (15:02 UTC 2026-09-17), first misread as an increase then as the wrong polarity — already closed as the trim classifier and polarity follow-ups. On OVH, grep for wasted paid PM calls:

```
sqlite3 /home/qamc/quant-agent/data/quant_agent.db \
  "SELECT COUNT(*), ROUND(SUM(COALESCE(cost_usd,0)), 6)
   FROM agent_logs
   WHERE agent_name = 'portfolio_manager'
     AND timestamp >= '2026-09-15'
     AND (status = 'pm_grounding_error'
          OR output_summary LIKE '%pm_grounding_error%'
          OR output_summary LIKE '%increase lacks a current-run Technical%');"
```

Do not invent a count from this checkout.

### 2026-09-17 — two jobs at once each opened the broker's live-fill socket, so neither could log in, and a dead socket made a stop wait longer than asking the broker

**In plain words:** the broker lets the desk keep one live connection that reports fills the instant they happen. The morning job and the midday job are separate programs. Each opened its own connection. The broker rejected the extras, the login loop stormed, and a protective stop could sit waiting on a dead connection for longer than it would have taken to just ask the broker once a second.

**Cause.** The desk already kept one socket inside a single program. That lock does not exist between programs. Starting the socket during the review so login overlaps the wait was not ownership of the account slot. Reading leftover fill messages on that socket was not ownership either. Lengthening the login retry was not the fix.

**Fix.** One program on the box holds a file lock for the account. That program may open the socket. Any other program uses that program's socket if it is the same process, or asks the broker over REST with the same time limit it always had — it does not open a second connection. A dead or unauthenticated socket falls to REST for whatever time is left, not for a second full wait on top.

**What this does not change.** Chase stays off. The login retry curve is still the broker library's own. No prices are invented. Paper only.

**What would catch it next time.** A test that a second process cannot open a competing socket while the lock is held; a test that the other process REST-polls with a bounded wait; a test that a stop/fill wait on a dead stream is no longer than the REST path.

---

**In plain words:** the macro seat was setting how much of the account should be invested, and on 17 September it said 80%. The trade-picking seat then skipped a clean CRM buy purely to stay near that number, and the risk seat had a standing prompt to shrink every buy when the book ran above it. Whatever cash was left was swept into a T-bill fund. You said: *"I want 100% invested. I don't want anything sitting in T-bills or any other positions that just yield interest."*

**Cause.** Not a code fault — a mandate the system was built to follow and you have now changed. The old rule allowed T-bills "when the desk genuinely finds nothing worth owning". Because the desk can short, that condition never honestly applies.

**Change.** The invested target is now a fixed 100% of equity, not a macro output. Macro still says which way to lean and which sectors. The risk seat's check now only speaks when the book is well under fully invested, and never asks for buys or shorts to be shrunk for being "above target". The T-bill sweep is switched off. Any T-bill fund still held is sold whole into cash at the start of the next market-hours session, so it cannot linger as an unprotected holding nothing is designed to sell.

**What this does not change.** Stops, per-trade risk, the drawdown ladder and the short-selling limits are untouched. The drawdown ladder can still force the book below fully invested (0.5x at worse than -20%), and that is deliberate.

**What would catch it next time.** Tests that the risk advisory never asks for a scale-down above target, that a legacy macro target cannot move the invested target, and that a held T-bill fund is released with the sweep off.

**2026-09-17 follow-up.** The "well under" threshold above had shipped as a flat 15 percentage points with no source, against the owner's standing no-arbitrary-numbers rule. It now reuses the sweep's own 1% cash reserve setting (`cash_sweep.reserve_pct`, fees/slippage buffer) as the tolerance — the only cash slice already sourced and owner-accepted — so the advisory fires whenever the book is short of fully invested by more than that reserve, and that setting is no longer read only by the retired sweep and a dashboard figure.

### 2026-09-17 — leftover reward-to-risk numbers were still killing and shrinking tickets after the floor itself had been retired (items 1 and 4, CLOSED)

**In plain words:** You had already said the desk must not refuse a trade just because a made-up payoff ratio was under one and a half. That refusal was gone. What was still armed was two leftovers of the same invention: just before sending, a range order could be skipped if execution moved the price and the new ratio fell under 1.2 (or under the already-approved thinner ratio), and the portfolio manager still cut a range ticket to the smallest size when the measurable ratio was under 1.5. Yesterday that first leftover killed RSG after the reviewer had approved it. You called residual reward-to-risk on live main a defect and said the numbers were just made up.

**Cause.** Removing the entry refusal in September left the execution belt and the starter-size cap in place on purpose at the time — one as "did execution make the approved trade worse?", one as a risk-reducing cap nobody had asked to loosen. Both still compared every range ticket to a flat unsourced number. The 1.2 belt did not care that the constructor had already shipped RSG under 1.5: when the limit was raised, executed geometry of 0.45 against an approved 0.81 was a skip. The 1.5 cap had already shrunk the same name to 0.50% risk. Neither number has a source.

**Fix.** A computed reward-to-risk ratio cannot skip an order and cannot shrink one. The 1.2 execution belt and the geometry-ratio skip are gone. The 1.5 starter-size cap on a measurable range payoff is gone. Unmeasurable payoff is recorded as unknown ranking information — it does not refuse, skip, size-cap, or open a catalyst-exception door. Chase/repeg stays off. No new numeric floor was invented. A breakout is still not judged on reward-to-risk at all. The real per-trade ratio still ranks candidates against each other when it exists.

**What this does not close.** The original census share (17 of 68 for the floor, 4 of 68 for the execution belt) was counted on the old refusal, not re-run against the same 68 after this leftover removal. Item 3 — tape walking away from an open limit, repeg off — is unchanged. Analyst conviction bands that mention 1.5–2.0 in prose are ranking language, not Python gates.

**What would catch it next time.** A test that the old geometry-ratio skip is not written as an execution skip; a test that an RSG-like executed ratio under the old 1.2 belt does not skip; a test that a measurable range ratio under 1.5 keeps the size the portfolio manager asked for; a test that an unmeasurable range payoff is kept at the asked size, not dropped and not starter-capped.

### 2026-09-16 — a bookkeeping latch, not the spend cap, switched paid analysis off after lunch; several other gates slept through the same day

**In plain words:** the afternoon and the close never looked at new trades because the desk thought it could not bound the day's model bill. Real spend was well under the cap. Separately, a stored economics snapshot could not be re-read, soft-exit notes were wiped to blank at industrial scale, two hot insider names never got a pre-market filing check, stop-mismatch pages repeated the same COP/EQNR pair all day, a BRK-B fractional remainder stayed uncovered, and the 09:30 and 1:00 scans skipped paid discovery because morning and midday were still (or had just been) running.

**Cause.** A successful model call that had an earlier ambiguous retry incremented the "unknown cost rows" counter even though the winner reported a real dollar figure. That counter is what hard-latches the day. Caps were not the problem and were not raised. The economics re-read failed because the on-disk snapshot dropped the required reasoning chain and stored sector tilts as a map, not the live list; validation correctly refused that shape rather than inventing a chain. Soft-exit blanks were mostly empty defaults being counted as drops, plus explicit JSON nulls wiping a field the model had already stated. Earnings preprocess only asked the configured universe, so Form-4 names admitted later (FTK, RSG) arrived as placeholders. Identical archive-vs-broker fingerprints re-paged every tick. Placing the whole-share GTC stop first reserved the shares so the DAY remainder was refused as held_for_orders. The scan treated a recent trade row as "another session is still flying" and skipped the tick instead of waiting for the live owner lock to clear.

**Fix.** Book the winner's cost and keep the day exact — the booked increment is that number, not a guess and not an inexact flag. Do not increment the unknown-row counter and do not latch. Persist the reasoning chain and the live sector rows so a same-day snapshot can re-validate; if it still cannot, record a durable missing-field reason and do not pass the broken snapshot into the portfolio manager — do not loosen validation. Keep a stated soft-exit; record `unknown` when an actionable seat sends JSON null; do not invent a falsifier. A name still empty after that heal is refused by itself before risk review so one blank cannot veto the rest of the plan. Union Form-4 admission-eligible names into the filing check with no new name-count cap. Write the live protective order back onto the opening row when reconcile finds a mismatch; remaining mismatches still page — do not mute an alert without fixing the record. Place the DAY remainder first; if the broker says shares are held, treat an already-live covering stop as success. Snapshot movers first, then wait for morning/midday to finish; if the lock is still held, skip with a durable reason that names the movers. A finished session's fills are not an in-flight lock.

**What this does not close.** Chase stays off. Slippage and reward-to-risk were not loosened to hide lateness. Seat-count was not invented. A fully-failed ambiguous call and a completed call with no telemetry still latch. An old snapshot with no chain still fails to parse. Neutral Tech still leaves the soft-exit empty.

**What would catch it next time.** Tests that a known-cost winner after an ambiguous retry stays exact and does not hard-latch, that a stored economics snapshot with a chain re-parses and one without names the missing field and is not passed through as usable, that null is recordable don't-know and a stated string survives, that one empty name is isolated before risk without inventing text or vetoing the rest of the plan, that hot insider names join the filing check, that a live protective order is written back on mismatch and remaining mismatches still page, that a held_for_orders DAY remainder is covered when the broker already holds it, and that a contended lock skip names the movers instead of dropping them.

### 2026-09-16 — pay again only when that kind of fact expired or was never good; missing research self-heals; desk delay is not "working as designed"

**In plain words:** the desk was treating every later-in-the-day look as if it had to re-buy the morning, or else freeze. The owner rule is simpler: remember a fact until the event that would make it false. Filings and the economic regime usually last across days. Price and a breaking wire do not. An empty or unreadable answer is not a fact, and the desk must repair it rather than sit frozen. Separately, a still-sound trade killed by the desk's own delay after the reviewer said yes is not the same thing as the market walking away from a limit.

**Cause.** Reuse was labelled by session type and "does today's file exist", not by what kind of evidence it was. A yesterday economics call that had not changed was treated as missing. A websocket handshake after approval could burn the fill wait, and the skip that followed looked like ordinary slippage. Soft-exit notes the model had actually written could be blanked; a stored economics snapshot used a different shape than the live answer, so the parse failed.

**Fix.** Each kind has an expiry event, not a seat-count and not a new clock: news when a newer wire lands or the session ends; price always re-read live at the order; regime until a real regime or print change; earnings until the next report or a material amendment; insider filings until a new filing. Same-session reuse of a good morning answer stays usable. A blank or failed parse is never reused as research. Repair order is mechanical first, then at most one paid retry inside the existing spend caps; a failed repair or a cap block pages the owner; a successful repair is written down, not paged. Desk lateness after the reviewer said yes is broken, not "a little late": the broker connection starts during the review so handshake is not added afterwards; steps that need time use the budgets already in the code; a ticket past that budget is refused as the window closing even if the price still looks fine. One catch-up inside the already-approved price is a safety net only. Chase stays off. Reward-to-risk was not loosened.

**What this does not close.** How many usable reads is "enough" is still the owner's (item 20 counting half). Item 3's ordinary unfilled-limit cost — the market walked away, chase off — remains working as designed. Earnings preprocess order was not changed.

**What would catch it next time.** Tests that a good same-session answer is reused, that a blank or lost answer is not, that mechanical repair runs before a paid retry and that retry happens at most once, that handshake starts during review and is not waited out after approval, that a ticket past the coded budget is refused as the window closing even inside the price ceiling, that catch-up is not the healthy path, that a catch-up cannot raise the approved ceiling, and that chase stays off.

---

### 2026-09-16 — the later scan treated this morning's own research as broken data and refused a whole plan (item 20, Risk half of the skip/lost split)

**In plain words:** about forty minutes after a successful morning, the desk proposed one more trade and the risk reviewer refused the entire plan because the news, economics and earnings seats had not been paid for again. They had already run that morning. Reusing them was a spend choice, not a missing file. Calling that "stale" or "degraded" was sloppy: the same session is not stale. The reviewer is not supposed to need a person in the loop, and the desk is not supposed to spend another round of model calls at ten o'clock to re-buy research it already has.

**Cause.** The earlier split already told the cheap coverage check the difference: "we chose not to re-read" versus "this morning's answer never arrived". The second still stops the expensive decision step before it runs. The risk reviewer was not using that split. Any seat status other than "ok" or "empty" counted as degraded, and two such seats produced a warning that the plan was built on incomplete input. On a later-in-the-day tick the reused morning seats and the intentional earnings skip are always those other words, so the warning always fired, and the reviewer treated it as a data-integrity failure of the whole book.

**Fix.** Same-session reuse and the intentional skip are now treated as usable for that warning, the same way the coverage check already treated them as not-lost. If the morning answer really never arrived, the scan still refuses before the expensive decision step — prefer that refusal over paying to refresh. The warning, when it still fires for a real failure, names only the seats that actually failed, so reuse words cannot sneak back into the reviewer's prompt on a mixed tick. Earnings is still not re-read on the later scan (a filing that arrived after the morning has not been read). How many usable reads is "enough" was not invented. Reward-to-risk and slippage gates were not loosened. Chase/repeg was not enabled. No default "what would kill this trade" or "catalyst" wording was invented.

**What this does not close.** Item 20's counting half is still the owner's. Two other things the same refusal also named — calendars not fetched on that tick, and empty "what would kill this" / "catalyst" fields — were not this defect and were not redesigned here. Age of a morning read by the afternoon is not a new rule; the later scan's design is to reuse the morning, not to re-buy it.

**What would catch it next time.** A test that a later-scan status of reused morning news/economics plus an intentional earnings skip does not send the risk reviewer a data-degraded warning; a test that two real seat failures still do, without naming the reuse words; a test that an empty or failed morning lookup still refuses before the expensive decision step; a test that the intentional skip and a lost morning lookup remain different labels.

### 2026-09-16 — the two things that could refuse a sale were failing safe in opposite directions (WORK.md item 60, CLOSED)

**In plain words:** when the desk wanted to sell, two separate checks could say no, and they treated "I cannot tell" as opposite answers. If the second-opinion reviewer was silent or unreadable, the sale went ahead — you approved that on 27 August, because blocking a sale just because a language model is down would trap the desk in a position whose story had already broken. But if the sale's written reason simply did not contain one of a short list of recognised phrases, the sale was blocked. The desk was treating a quiet reviewer as more trustworthy than a reviewer that was working and wording things unexpectedly. The only behaviour actually measured on this path was over-refusal: eight proposed sales, the reviewer approved all eight, the automatic rules blocked all eight (seven as "too small a move", one as "no recognised phrase").

**Cause.** The two checks were written as if "could not tell" meant the same event. It does not. A silent or unreadable reviewer is uncertainty. A filled-in reason that names no recognised trigger is a finished answer: the automatic rules looked, and the answer is no. Treating those as one fail-direction made the pair look incoherent, and because the phrase check ran *after* the reviewer, a silent reviewer could in principle wave through a sale the phrase check would have refused if it had gone first.

**Fix.** Automatic rules own refusal. A reason that names no recognised trigger is still blocked — that is not a change in how readily the desk sells — and those sales are no longer even shown to the reviewer, so a silent reviewer cannot contradict them. Uncertainty (silent reviewer, or the phrase check itself unable to run) fails open on both sides, which is the 27 August rule applied to the pair rather than to one half. The reviewer can still add a refusal when it actually speaks; it cannot override an automatic block. Every blocked sale, and every "could not tell, so it went through", is now written down against that stock in a record that a later note on the same stock the same session cannot erase. How far a move has to go before it counts as real, and how tight a stop may be — both still the unsourced figure 1.0 — were not touched. That is a different item, still open.

**What this does not close.** How readily the desk should block a sale at all remains yours (appetite) and was not this item's plumbing question. The unsourced 1.0 doing two jobs — including the noise-band job that blocked seven of the eight recorded sales — remains open as item 70, which now carries that measured over-refusal. Profit-taking was not redesigned. Shorts were not added. Repeating a sale was not changed. Extending fail-open from a silent reviewer to a phrase-matcher that itself raises is an engineering application of the 27 August posture, not a new owner ruling.

**What would catch it next time.** A test that a silent reviewer does not block a sale whose reason names a real trigger; a test that a sale whose reason names no trigger is never sent to the reviewer and is still blocked; a test that two different block-reasons for the same stock in the same session both survive in the record. Those fail if the two layers are again allowed to disagree silently about "could not tell".

---

### 2026-09-16 — the thirty-minute scan no longer treats "chose not to re-read" and "this morning's research never arrived" as the same thing (item 20, intraday half)

**In plain words:** the later-in-the-day scan used one label for two opposite facts — we deliberately did not re-buy a research seat, and this morning's seat failed so there was nothing to reuse. The first is an honest skip. The second is a missing answer. Because they looked the same, the scan could still pick trades after a morning whose research never arrived. They are now different labels, and the second refuses the decision the same way the morning session already does. Earnings stays an honest skip: that scan does not re-read filings.

**What this does not close.** How many usable reads is "enough" is still the owner's, and was not invented. Item 20 stays open on that counting half.

**What would catch it next time.** A test that an empty or failed morning lookup refuses the scan before the expensive decision seat, and a test that the intentional skip still does not.

---

### 2026-09-16 — when a stop moved, the desk kept writing the old number in its own records (WORK.md item 71, CLOSED)

**In plain words:** every time the protective stop on a holding was moved — trailed up, shifted for a dividend, put back after a repair, rearmed after adding to a winner — the broker had the new price and our own trade record still had the price from the day we opened. Anyone reading that record, including two earlier board items that looked like "the stock traded through its own stop", was looking at a number that had been retired days before.

**Cause.** `trades.stop_loss` was written once, on the opening purchase or short row, and nothing wrote it back. Trails cancelled and replaced the broker order. Coverage repair placed whatever the opening row still said. Scale-in rearm could tighten the live stop without touching the add's recorded stop. An out-of-band broker edit left no row at all. The running desk was never confused: the reviewer already asked the broker for distance-to-stop. Only the archive was stale, silently, so any stop-distance or R-at-exit figure drawn from `trades` could be days old.

**Fix.** Every path that changes a stop now writes the accepted level back onto that opening row. Replacements go through one funnel (`replace_stop_loss` plus the write-back) so a trail cannot land at the broker and miss the archive. Repair, scale-in rearm, an ex-dividend shift, and re-protecting a leftover after a partial sale do the same. A kill-switch or missing-id payload is not written back. The original entry stop is kept separately so R-multiple still measures the bet that was actually made, not the level a trail later moved it to. Repair restores that live recorded level; refusing a stop that would fire immediately is still a refuse — putting the entry stop back would be a widen. A reconciliation then compares the recorded number to the broker's live stop and reports a mismatch; it does not copy the broker price into the archive, because that would silently bless a move nobody in this code made. Shorts use the short row and a buy-stop; longs use the purchase row and a sell-stop. No new percentage was invented.

**What this does not close.** Items 35 and 69 (Visa and Disney "traded through their stop") stay closed as archive illusions; they are not re-filed as fixed. The halt still asks the broker whether a stop *exists* — a cancelled-and-not-replaced order is a missing order, not a stale price. Repair still refuses to invent a level when the opening row has none.

**What would catch it next time.** A test that trails, repairs, or rearms and then asserts the opening row's stop equals the new level, with the entry stop still frozen; and a test that plants a deliberate mismatch against the broker and asserts the reconcile reports it without writing. Those fail if any one replace path is left writing only to the broker.

---

### 2026-09-16 — practice runs against history still fund trades by ticker spelling when the risk ceiling runs out; they now say so on every result (WORK.md item 64, reporting shipped — ranking is not fixed)

**In plain words:** when a practice run has more trade ideas than the risk ceiling allows, it still funds them in alphabetical order. That is ticker spelling, not a judgement of which idea is better. Until now the printed result did not say that, so a reader could take the numbers as evidence about how the live desk picks among trades. Every result now prints how many of its days the ceiling ran out, and says the tie-break is alphabetical. The live desk still spends its budget on the best-ranked ideas first. The practice run still has no ranking, and this change does not give it one.

**What this does not close.** Ranking is not fixed. Item 64 stays open. A made-up score, copying live analyst ratings into the practice run, or ranking by the practice run's own reward-to-risk number (which the live desk uses only as a tie-break under the real ranking, never as the rank itself) were all ruled out: any of those would change who gets capital while still looking like a ranking fix. What would settle the rest: a score read off something the practice run already computes that is actually the live ranking rule — which needs the analyst ratings it cannot replay — or a decision that practice runs cannot evaluate rationing at all.

**What was wrong with the old printout.** It claimed the numbers measured the portfolio risk budget. They ran that budget, but on a binding day they measured ticker order. The count of binding days is also not a discount you can apply to the other numbers: who got funded changes later account size, later position size, and later outcomes.

**What would catch it next time.** A test that a two-name day where only one idea fits funds the earlier ticker and reports a binding day; a test that a result with zero binding days still prints the count and the alphabetical label; a test that the side-by-side comparison table carries the count; a test that the practice run still sends the same risk for every name and does not pass a ranking, while the live path still does.

### 2026-09-15 — a short that lost its protective stop was never given one back (WORK.md item 73, CLOSED)

**In plain words:** if the desk bets against a stock and the protective order
on that bet goes missing, nothing put it back. The same gap on a stock the
desk owns was already repaired automatically. Both repair checks noticed the
short's gap, wrote it down, and walked away.

**Cause.** Four long-only leftovers from when shorts could not be opened, all
still live after SHORT became a real opening action. The lookup that finds
"where should this stop sit" only read purchase rows. The repair itself always
placed a sell-stop and refused if that stop was at or above the live price —
correct for a long, the wrong side and the wrong guard for a short. The
session sweep and the half-hourly coverage check both skipped shorts on the
false claim that there was no recorded level to restore. There was: the short
entry row already stores the stop the same way a purchase does.

**Fix.** The lookup can now read a short entry without changing what
purchase-memory callers see. Repair places a buy-stop at that recorded level,
refuses if the stop would fire immediately (at or below the live price), and
uses the same stop-limit buffer the entry path already uses, on the ask side
of a buy-stop. Both repair callers invoke it. Direction is a required
argument, not a long default. A lookup that cannot say "this is a short row"
fails closed rather than silently using a purchase's stop. No new percentage
was invented, and nothing here re-pegs an entry.

**What this does not close.** When a stop is later trailed, the desk's own
record of it is still not updated (item 71). Repair restores the *entry* stop,
the same as it already did for longs. A winning long whose live stop had been
tightened can therefore be re-protected wider than it actually was; a short
does not currently trail in-code at all (the trail path still asks only for a
purchase row), so the same widened-restore case on a short can arise only from
an out-of-band change. That is item 71, and a separate long-bias in trailing,
not a reason to leave shorts naked. Adding to an existing short is still not
the long scale-in path: that sequence cancels a sell-stop, buys, and rearms;
a short add would have to cancel and rearm a buy-stop, which was not built
there.

**What would catch it next time.** A test that removes a short's stop and
asserts a buy-stop comes back at the short row's own level, a test that a
purchase-only lookup cannot repair a short, and a test that a sub-share
remainder on a short (whole-share buy-stop intact) still places a buy-stop
from the short row. Those fail if any one of the repair sites is left
long-biased.

### 2026-09-15 — adding to a winner is allowed by taking its protective sell off first, confirming it is gone, buying, then putting one sell back over the whole holding

**In plain words:** the broker will not let the desk buy more of a stock that already has a sell-stop resting on it. The old answer was to refuse the add. The owner ruled that is the wrong answer. The desk now takes the stop off, waits until the broker says it is actually gone, buys, and then places one new stop over however many shares it really holds — including a partial fill of the add. If putting that stop back fails, you are told. It does not add to a stock it is already short: scale-in is the long path.

**Why refuse-the-add was wrong.** A resting protective sell and a new buy cannot both be working on the same name. Silent refusal looked like safety and was actually a hidden cap on adding to winners. Path B is the sequence, not a new kind of order and not a profit target.

**Why this is the daily-breaker's lesson, not a repeat of it.** On 2026-09-14 the whole-book daily-loss dump was removed because its sequence was: cancel every protective stop, try to sell, and on any leg that did not fill, put the original stop back. On a gap that dump would have cancelled every stop, sold nothing, and restored — an unprotected window on the exact day it existed for. Scale-in is the same *shape* (cancel a stop to free the shares), and that is why the objections were: the crash window, a partial fill restoring the wrong size, a race with the trail and the coverage repair, timers pretending a cancel had landed, and a bracket/take-profit that would fight the desk's rule that protection is a GTC stop after the fill, not a preset profit target.

**What those objections changed in the design.** The recovery row is written *before* the cancel, so a crash cannot leave the position naked without a record of what to put back. The cancel is confirmed from the broker's live order stream, not from the cancel call returning. The new stop is sized to the broker's full position, not to the add's fill and not to the cancelled stop's old size. If the buy submit fails in a way that leaves it unknown whether the order landed, the old stop is *not* put back at the old size — that would under-cover a fill that may already have happened; the recovery row stays and the next session rearms at whatever the broker currently holds. The trail, the in-session coverage repair and the half-hourly coverage check skip a name that has that recovery row so they cannot re-place the stop that was just cancelled (which would recreate the original block) and cannot resize it while the add is in flight. There is no take-profit leg and no bracket. Automatic repricing of the entry stays off.

**What is still unprotected, stated rather than hidden.** Between confirmed cancel and successful rearm the position has no stop. A crash in that window is recovered from the write-ahead row, not prevented. That is the cost of adding at this broker. A failed rearm pages the owner rather than going quiet.

**Shorts are out of this change.** Scale-in is the long path (cancel a sell-stop, buy, rearm). A short add would cancel a buy-stop and rearm it; that sequence was not built here. Missing short stops are repaired separately (item 73, closed). New shorts on a name the desk does not already hold are unchanged.

### 2026-09-14 — reasoning models were let think themselves out of an answer, and every model was graded under its own hidden settings instead of one shared one

**In plain words:** when the benchmark tested candidate models through
OpenRouter, it never told them how hard to think or what shape to answer in.
Two reasoning models (qwen3.8-flash, glm-5.3) spent their entire answer
budget on hidden "thinking" and had nothing left to write the actual
decision — they scored 0, not because they were bad at the job, but because
nobody told them how much of the budget thinking was allowed to use. Every
other model was silently using its own default too, so the models were never
being compared on a level footing to begin with.

**Cause.** `src/agents/base.py`'s OpenRouter request sent only
`usage.include` and `provider.order` as extras — no `reasoning` effort and
no `response_format`. Every model defaulted to its own provider-chosen
thinking budget and its own idea of how to format JSON.

**Fix.** One explicit setting for every OpenRouter seat, sourced from
OpenRouter's own docs (reasoning tokens:
https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/reasoning-tokens; structured outputs:
https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/structured-outputs), no per-model
exceptions:
- `reasoning: {"effort": "medium"}` sent on every OpenRouter call
  (`llm.reasoning_effort` in `config/settings.yaml`, default `"medium"` —
  OpenRouter's own documented default).
- `response_format` (strict JSON schema) sent for every seat that has a
  known result model (`BaseAgent.result_model`); a schema that can't be made
  strict-compatible falls back to `strict:false` rather than being dropped,
  logged once per model.
- The benchmark (`ops/model_policy/benchmark_models.py`) drives the same
  agent classes, so it inherits this automatically, and its results file
  now records the `reasoning_effort`/`structured_output` actually used per
  trial.

**Deliberately unchanged.** The Google AI Studio direct path (used by most
live analyst seats today) and any other non-OpenRouter path are untouched —
this fix is scoped to the OpenRouter wire only, per the owner's brief. The
Tech Analyst and Smart Money seats, whose top-level response is a JSON
array/list wrapper rather than a single object, are left without
`response_format`: OpenAI/OpenRouter strict schemas require an object root,
and reshaping those two agents' output contract was out of scope.

**Follow-up, same day (PR #412 update).** "Deliberately unchanged" above was
wrong for the owner's actual requirement (identical settings on the route
the live desk uses) — 7 live seats call Google AI Studio direct, not
OpenRouter. Google's own OpenAI-compatibility endpoint documents an
equivalent `reasoning_effort` (flat, not nested under `reasoning`) and the
same `response_format` support (https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai,
fetched 2026-09-14); both now go out on the Google-direct path too, driven
by the same `llm.reasoning_effort`/`llm.structured_output` config, and the
benchmark gained a `google-direct:<model>` prefix to test that exact route.

### 2026-09-14 — during market hours the desk judged every price against yesterday's close, so a stock trading below its support still read as above it

**In plain words:** the price history every seat reads always stopped at
the previous day — even in the evening, after today had closed. So in the
morning the desk compared stops, supports and breakouts against a price
that was a day old. ORCL on 2026-09-10 opened at 158.38, under the desk's
own 159.79 support, and nothing on the desk could see it. The desk now
reads the live price for those comparisons while the market is open, and
says plainly when it cannot get one.

**Cause.** `MarketDataProvider.get_ohlcv` passed `end=et_today()` to
yfinance, whose `end` is exclusive. Every consumer got bars through
yesterday at all hours. The intraday scan already worked around it with
broker snapshots (2026-08-19); the morning Tech pass, the nomination
responder and the prefilter did not. Levels were classified support vs
resistance against the last completed close.

**Fix.**
- `get_ohlcv` now returns completed daily bars only, bounded by
  `trading_calendar.last_completed_bar_date()`: the previous session while
  the market is open, today from 16:00 ET. An in-progress bar from either
  source (the Alpaca fallback can return one) is dropped and logged.
- Morning Tech and the nomination responder get the live price from the
  existing broker snapshot during regular hours. Levels are classified
  against it. The prompt shows it as a labelled in-progress session, never
  as a bar.
- No live price, or a last trade not from today: logged, and the prompt
  says LIVE PRICE UNAVAILABLE / STALE. Yesterday is never passed off as today.
- The prefilter's price-vs-Bollinger check uses the live price.

**Deliberately unchanged.** ATR, moving averages, pivots and the levels
themselves stay on completed bars. Structural protection still requires a
break on a CLOSE (its own documented rule). The trailing stop already used
the broker's live position price.

**Known limits.** Early-close days (13:00 ET) are treated as "not complete"
until 16:00: stale, but labelled. How soon after 16:00 yfinance publishes
the final daily bar is not verified. The evening session (20:00) is not
affected by that.

### 2026-09-14 — the model exam's only real trading day could not measure the one number the desk now admits trades on; it has been swapped for a day that can (WORK.md item 72, CLOSED)

**In plain words:** the test we use to compare models for the trade-picking
seat was built from a morning where the desk's price-level data had not been
recorded. The desk decides which ideas are even allowed by measuring
reward against risk from those levels, so on that morning it could measure
nothing — and the test was quietly calling 13 names "allowed" that the real
desk would have refused. The test now uses the next morning, where the level
data exists for every name that matters.

**What was wrong.** `pm_selection` replayed `run-64290730` (2026-09-01). None
of its 59 analysis rows carried `computed_levels`, so the structural
reward:risk that the live admission gate reads was None for every name.
The scenario's own notes said admission "does not depend on it". That was
true only of the grader's shadow of the rules, which reads the analyst's own
ratio. **Measured 2026-09-14:** the live `candidate_eligibility` handed the
real (all-None) structural ratios admits **12** names on that file, and the
grader admitted **25**. So nearly half the names the exam credited as
admitted were ones production would refuse as unmeasurable.

**What replaced it.** Production `run-bba4d4f3` (2026-09-02 13:31 UTC),
captured the same way: the read-only Mission Control API's per-symbol rows,
plus the run's own recorded prompt for account, memory and insights. The
board item's recorded counts were checked, not copied, and held:
64 analyses, **63 with computed levels** (the one without, MRVL, is rated
neutral), **34 actionable, all 34 with a computable structural ratio**
(14 breakout / 20 range). On this day the live gate with the real ratios and
the grader's shadow admit the identical 25 names, one of them a short
(FLNC). The live PM proposed nine targets, the risk seat approved them, and
the funnel still recorded zero orders; why is not established by the pull.

**What was ruled out.** Tuning anything to make the new day pass: expected
answers come only from the existing rules, and nothing was hand-picked. The
three older audits that pin their write-ups to 2026-09-01 were left on that
day rather than silently re-derived, which is the only reason the old file
is still in the repo.

**A stale number found on the way.** The benchmark notes said the rendered
prompt is 194,173 characters. That was measured on 2026-09-01 and the
renderer has changed since: the old fixture renders at 87,119 characters
today and the new one at 87,247 (measured through the live renderer).

**What catches it next time.** The scenario now refuses to import if the
fixture has fewer than 63 rows with levels or any actionable name without a
structural ratio, and a test fails if the live gate and the grader ever
disagree on the admitted set.

### 2026-09-14 — the agent backlog (docs/WORK.md) was a fifth history and repeated reasoning; the finished and superseded parts were removed after checking each against the code

**In plain words:** the file every agent session loads had filled up with
descriptions of work that was already built, decisions already made, and
warnings about things that no longer exist. None of it was open work, but
every session paid to read it and some of it pointed agents the wrong way.
Each block was checked against the code on main before it was removed. Every
numbered item survived; no item number was retired by this pass.

**Removed, and why each was no longer live:**

- **"ITEM 0 CONTINUED — PM-input architecture" (2026-09-02, marked NOT YET
  IMPLEMENTED).** Its three steps were all done or owned elsewhere: counting
  what every seat forwards to the trade-picking seat was done 2026-09-13
  ("item 18d / PM gate item 7", this file); reshaping the bulky sections was
  the same work plus the 2026-09-14 macro-audit answer box ("item 18e");
  the benchmark it asked for is item 76. The one example it measured (macro's
  full reasoning rendered verbatim) is still rendered, deliberately, under an
  audit instruction that now has somewhere to put its answer.
- **Resolved lines in DECISIONS PENDING.** The "a level needs 5 touches"
  ruling of 2026-09-03 is superseded: the touch count is now 2 and sourced
  (item 55, 2026-09-14). The drawdown sensitivity (3.0, 2026-09-11), the macro
  freshness question (2026-09-11), and the silence-watchdog threshold
  (2026-09-03) each already have their own entry here. The "second alert
  channel, deferred" line duplicated funnel item 17, which keeps it.
- **Cost-circuit stopgap values** (`max_paid_sessions_per_mode_per_day: 8`,
  `daily_reserved_exposure_limit_usd: 5.50`, "not the final values"). Neither
  key exists in the settings any more; the config loader now lists both as
  retired names (2026-09-04 entry, "acceptance test broken on main by deleted
  cost-circuit config keys").
- **"Duplicate Phase 2b work in flight"** in a separate worktree. That worktree
  no longer exists on disk and git lists no worktree of that name.
- **"The rig's acceptance test no longer passes" (2026-09-02).** Re-diagnosed
  and rewritten 2026-09-13 (item 28 entry, this file).
- **Item 18's `familiarity_bias` bullet** ("graded but never stated in the
  prompt"). Since 2026-09-14 it grades nothing: it is a weight-0 diagnostic
  in the model benchmark (`ops/model_policy/README.md`).
- **One-off instructions** from 2026-08-29 ("the next session runs overnight
  and must not ask anything") and pointer lines to material already moved
  here.

**Kept, shortened:** every numbered item, the one pending decision with its
date, the PM-gate EMPTY marker, and the standing rules other files point at
("Engineering setup", "Operational facts").

**What would catch it next time:** the no-growth test on WORK.md forces a
prune on every write; this pass is what that rule looks like when it has been
skipped for a while.

### 2026-09-14 — the reward:risk floor stopped refusing trades, and the four-part plan written for it is all built (funnel item 1, shrunk, not closed)

**In plain words:** the rule that refused any trade whose likely gain was under
1.5 times its risk was the single largest reason the desk did not trade — 17
of 68 proposals between 2026-08-18 and 2026-09-02, and the Risk Manager was
also halving other positions "per R/R enforcement policy" (XLF, XLE twice,
XLB), which that count did not include. It failed in both directions at once:
it refused good trades on a ratio the stop-padding rule had invented, and it
waved famous names through an exception that the desk's own news feed could
always satisfy.

**The reasoning, so it is not re-derived:**

- **Refusing on an invented ratio.** Run `run-64290730` (2026-09-01): SLB
  entered at $60.10 with its stop at $55.50 — exactly the 3.0x ATR floor, not
  a chart level — for a reward:risk of 1.28 against a geometric maximum of
  1.29. Once padding rather than a level sets the stop, the floor cannot be
  cleared.
- **The exception handed out the key to its own lock.** A below-floor pick
  was allowed with a named catalyst. On NVDA the model did everything the rule
  asked — named a catalyst, cut size, stated the ratio was below floor, and the
  Risk Manager agreed. The catalyst came from our own news feed, and a famous
  name always has one.
- **It was not the model recognising the name.** Blinding the ticker
  (2026-09-02) changed nothing: NVDA was picked 5 of 5 in both arms, quality
  identical to four decimal places. The cause was the gate.
- **Retracted example, do not re-cite:** "the PM assumed R/R 1.67 but the
  order had 1.18" was entry-price drift between snapshot and fill, not the
  floor; the stop was identical on both (spec, 2026-09-04 correction).

**The four parts, all built:** (a) one stop geometry everywhere, and a stop
backed by a real level is honoured however tight — merged 2026-09-02; the
padding multiple (2.5x ATR) applies only where no level backs the stop
(2026-09-10). (b) the catalyst must point at a stored, dated row and its
direction is checked, not just its existence (2026-09-02 and 2026-09-03).
(c) a below-floor pick is capped at the smallest starter size in code, after
the model answers; on 2026-09-11 a verified below-floor catalyst could
actually produce a trade for the first time. (d) owner decision 2026-09-11:
no reward:risk test at all for a breakout (nothing overhead to measure a
reward against; the position is trailed), and for a range trade the ratio is
a ranking tiebreak and a thin payoff is size-capped rather than refused. The
execution-time re-check (funnel item 4) followed: none for a breakout, and
`min(1.2, approved ratio)` for a range order, so it cannot reinstate the floor
at the last step.

**Also recorded:** the PM's "Proposal Conversion" block (telling the desk what
it keeps asking for and not getting) shipped 2026-09-02 and was blind the same
day, because the reset erased the 21 days of history it reads.

**Why item 1 is not closed:** the 1.5 figure still decides which range trades
are capped at starter size, and has no source; the catalyst exception no
longer changes any outcome and nobody has decided whether to remove it; and
the 68-proposal census has not been re-run. The board test also pins the
item's headline.

### 2026-09-14 — a morning whose research never arrived now stops before the trade-picking seat instead of deciding on half the evidence (item 20, categorical half built)

**In plain words:** if one of the research seats failed outright — the call
broke, the reply was unreadable, the provider was down — the desk still went
on to pick trades as if that seat had simply found nothing. The owner's ruling
of 2026-09-02 was that a decision made without the information is not a weaker
decision but a made-up one. The morning session now refuses to decide when any
seat's answer was lost, spends nothing further, and says so.

**Why it needs no number.** Every status a seat writes is sorted into three
kinds: a usable answer; an honest empty answer (no insider filings today is a
fact, not a gap); or a lost answer. Only the third refuses the run. That is a
yes-or-no fact, so there is no threshold to invent, drift, or fit to the
desk's own history. It reads the statuses the seats already report, and a test
lists the whole vocabulary so a new status word must be classified in the same
change.

**It is loud three ways** — its own owner alert, the existing data-quality
page, and a session status classed as a warning, not a quiet day. It returns
before any target exists, so it cannot produce the "0% target means sell"
shape, and every symbol that reached a technical read gets a durable row
saying why no decision was made on it.

**Measured bite before shipping:** replayed against the desk's own logs, 5 of
the 27 historical morning runs that reached the trade-picking seat (19%) would
have been refused, on 4 of 13 trading days. Four of the five are one recurring
fault — the news analyst replying with something that is not JSON (08-17
twice, 08-18, 08-25, and two saved parse failures on 2026-09-04); the fifth is
the SEC provider failing on 08-26.

**A correction to the item's own premise.** It assumed a skipped morning costs
half an hour because the 30-minute check retries. That check re-runs neither
the research nor the decision; the only thing that can decide again is a scan
of at most five names that moved 3% or more. On a quiet day a refused morning
is closer to a lost day. The ruling stands regardless.

**Left open on item 20:** whether partial coverage should also gate, and at
what count (owner's; no published source exists), and the intraday path, where
one status word means both "not asked" and "asked and lost".

### 2026-09-14 — the 2026-09-11 audit's unsourced numbers, checked one by one: all still in force, most owned by nothing

**In one line.** An audit three days earlier listed about twenty numbers that decide whether and how much the desk trades and have no source behind them. Each was re-checked against the live code. None had been fixed. Two are already on the board; the rest are owned by nothing.

**Why they are recorded here and not filed as twenty board items.** The desk's rule for an unowned number (`docs/OUTCOME.md`, outcome 3) is an owned board item stating the question, where the number came from, what was searched, what would settle it, and the cost while open — one object per item (item 55). A bulk list in that shape would not fit the backlog's byte cap and would bury the one finding from the same audit that can leave a position unprotected (item 73). So this is the verified inventory; each number becomes a board item when it is worked, in that format, and not before. It is not a decision that they are fine.

**Verified on origin/main 2026-09-14. Owned by an existing item:**
- insider dollar floors $100k / $250k — item 52.
- `NOISE_BAND_ATR_MULTIPLE` / `absolute_min_stop_atr_multiple` 1.0 — item 70 (a DIFFERENT 1.0 from the target multiples below).
- the reach caps split out of one number — item 56.

**Owned by nothing, all live:**
- correlation cluster threshold 0.7 (`src/data/correlation.py`) — called "the traditional finance cutoff", no citation.
- insider admission: 2 owners, $5 minimum price, $10M average daily dollar volume, 20 days of history (`src/config.py`, smart-money). The $10M and 20-day floors were already recorded as screening the wrong thing on 2026-09-01, under a redesign agreed and never built.
- `stop_atr_setup_scale` and `stop_atr_regime_scale` (`src/portfolio_constructor.py`) — the code admits "not a specific measured number"; the direction is doctrine, the magnitudes are picked. These multiply into every stop distance.
- `min_target_atr_multiple` and `breakout_projection_atr_multiple` 1.0 (`src/config.py`).
- nominations 3 per seat / 6 per run, and `max_external_candidates` 3 — affordability caps, not measurements.
- `max_single_short_pct` 10, `max_gross_bearish_pct` 20, `short_gap_risk_multiple` 1.5 — shorting is live, so all three bind; the first self-admits it stands "until a separate pass re-examines it".
- intraday scan: 3% move, 3-hour cooldown. **The scan is ON** — its settings comment said it had been left disabled; that comment was stale and is corrected in the same change.
- `MIN_RATCHET_PCT` 2.0 (`src/risk/trailing.py`) — the SAME rule as the reviewer prompt's `new_stop >= old_stop × 1.02`, kept deliberately identical; unsourced in both places.
- `CHANDELIER_ATR_MULTIPLE` 3.0 (`src/risk/trailing.py`) — "the conventional setting", uncited.

**Seen while checking, not on the audit's list:** `min_reward_risk_after_widening` 1.5 has no derivation; `min_stop_atr_multiple` 2.5 cites published doctrine for a 2.5–3.0 range but not the point value. The trailing-stop noise band 1.25×ATR is also unmeasured — its settings comment calls it MEASURED; nothing was.

**Where to start when this is worked.** The trailing-stop numbers (2% minimum step, the cooldown that restrains it, 1.25×ATR, Chandelier 3.0) were examined against a real case the same day: on ORCL they decide how much of a run-up the desk gives back. The stop-scale multipliers come next because they touch every trade.

### 2026-09-14 — the desk was shrinking positions by a rule of thumb that only works when its five analysts think independently, and they do not (agreement sizing ladder RETIRED)

**In plain words:** the desk had five analyst seats — chart, news, earnings,
big-picture, and institutional-flow — and it shrank a trade when fewer of
them agreed. The maths behind that shrinkage assumes the five are looking at
five separate things. They are not. They read the same tape, the same price
bars and the same filings, and several of them are literally the same AI
model asked a different question. Agreement between them is much weaker
evidence than the formula assumed, so the formula could not be justified at
any setting. It has been deleted. What survives, unchanged, is the refusal:
if the evidence does not net out in favour of a trade, the desk does not
take it at all.

**What the rule was.** `risk.agreement_ceiling_pct` scaled the risk a
position was allowed to carry by the net number of agreeing seats:
`max_position_risk_pct x sqrt(n / 5)`. It had been improved earlier the same
day — retired items 30/57 replaced a hand-typed `[3, 4, 5, 5, 5]` with that
derived square-root curve. The derivation was honest about its own
precondition and stated it in the docstring: the square-root law is the
statistics of averaging INDEPENDENT estimates. The owner read that caveat and
ruled that a precondition the desk knowingly fails is not a caveat, it is a
disqualification. Correlated seats earn less than sqrt(N) credit, and there
is no measured correlation on this desk to haircut it with — inventing one
would have been the arbitrary number the derivation had just removed.

**The second reason, which is the same defect the rotation rule already
had.** A graduated ceiling cannot tell "the seats disagreed" from "the seats
had nothing to look at". A thinly covered small-cap with one chart read and a
heavily covered name where the macro seat is arguing the other way arrive at
the same low net score and were sized identically. Retired board item 66 had
already established that a scarcity of evidence and a conflict of evidence
are different facts. The refusal is the only place that distinction is safe
to act on, because at or below zero the desk declines to take a view either
way.

**The measured bite, read from the data rather than estimated.** Over the
archived sized targets in the pre-reset production database (25 targets on
2026-08-31..2026-09-02 with an archived canonical seat-stance snapshot; 30
targets on 2026-08-28..2026-09-02 counting those whose net could only be
recovered from the PM's own provenance), the graduated rungs capped **zero**
of them. Every rung sat above every ask: the largest single request in the
whole window was 2.80% risk at a net of +3, against a rung-3 ceiling of
3.873%, and the only rung that could plausibly have bitten (rung 1, 2.236%)
was never reached by a net-+1 request larger than 1.50%. The **refusal** bit
once — UNH on 2026-09-02, net 0. On the separate `run-64290730` audit fixture
the ladder did cap the theoretical MAXIMUM permitted risk of 6 of 25 eligible
candidates, 3.51 points out of 60.0, but that is a cap on what the rules
permit rather than on anything the PM asked for. In short: the ladder had
never once changed a real position size. This is stated plainly because the
opposite finding — "it was cutting most positions by a quarter" — was the
outcome the owner asked to be checked for, and it is not what the data says.

**What agreement still does.** It orders which candidates get funded first,
through `rank_verdicts` and the risk-budget allocator's priority (retired
item 49). Agreement earns the queue position. It does not set the size.

**What would catch a regression.** `risk.agreement_ceiling_pct` is now
REJECTED on config load — a stale deployment whose settings file still
carries the list fails loudly rather than loading a ladder nothing reads,
the same posture already taken for the deleted repeg key. A test asserts
that no agreement-keyed sequence of size numbers exists anywhere: not in the
risk constants, not as a field on either config model, not in
`config/settings.yaml`.

**Adversary:** argued that deleting the ladder loosens risk on exactly the
thinly-evidenced names it was meant to restrain, and that a measured bite of
zero could be an artefact of a book that never asked for size in the first
place. Both are conceded as true statements and neither changes the
decision: the per-trade envelope, the portfolio at-risk ceiling, the cluster
share cap and the notional single-name cap all still bind, and a rule whose
justification is unsound should not be kept merely because it is currently
inert — an inert wrong rule becomes an active wrong rule the moment the PM
asks for more size.

### 2026-09-14 — the daily-loss circuit breaker no longer sells the whole book; it stops the desk instead, and checks that what is held is actually protected

**In plain words:** if the account fell past its daily loss limit, the desk used to try to sell everything it owned. It never once did — the limit has never been reached — and had it ever tried on the kind of day it was built for, it would have made things worse rather than better. It now does something different: it stops taking new risk for the rest of the day, cancels any orders that were waiting to buy, keeps every position, and checks with the broker one holding at a time that each really does have a live protective stop on it. If any does not, you get told by name. Nothing is sold.

**Why the old response was worse than nothing on the day it mattered.** The sell orders it placed were LIMIT orders priced 1% away from the market, not market orders. On an ordinary day that fills. On a correlated gap — a day when everything drops together, which is the only kind of day a whole-book dump could be argued for — a limit 1% away does not fill. And the sequence it ran was: cancel each position's protective stop, place the limit sell, wait, and on any leg that did not fill, put the original stop back. So on the exact day it existed for, it cancelled every protective stop the desk had, sold nothing, and restored the stops — leaving an unprotected window and achieving nothing. It worked only when it was not needed.

**It had never fired.** Zero emergency-sell and zero emergency-cover rows in the archive, across thirteen days of recorded profit and loss. The worst single day on record is -0.46%. The trip point reconstructed against the last archived book at real prices comes out around -0.7% to -0.75% of the account, so the machinery being removed had never been close to running.

**The proportionate response already existed and was never the thing being removed.** When the book is carrying too much exposure, the §11.2 gross-exposure ladder trims the EXCESS down to a ceiling that steps lower as drawdown deepens, and it runs in the session preamble before any AI is involved. That is untouched. The other de-levering path is switched off entirely and has been since margin was turned on, so it is not what was protecting anything either. And this breaker was never the defence against the broker liquidating the account: at the configured 2x gross ceiling against a 25% maintenance requirement, the book can fall 33.3% before a margin call — that is a week of bad days, not one, and the ladder is what stands in front of it.

**The risk in the replacement, stated rather than hidden.** A halt is only safe if the per-position stops really are live at the broker — and the desk cannot answer that question from its own records. Earlier the same day the Visa case that looked like a failed stop (item 35) turned out to be the opposite: the stop was live the whole time and the *stored record* was four days stale, because the column holding it is written once when a position is opened and never updated when the stop is replaced. That correction does not weaken this precondition, it sharpens it — the archive is not evidence about stop coverage in EITHER direction, so the halt asks the broker rather than believing anything the desk wrote down. Two reasons the honest answer can still be "no" survive that audit: a stop can be moved by a maintenance action outside the desk's own trading code, leaving no trade row behind at all (three were moved that way on 2026-08-31 to bring grandfathered stops up to the minimum distance), and a sub-share remainder provably cannot hold an overnight stop at this broker. That is why verification is part of the halt rather than a report attached to it. Each holding is asked about individually, on the correct side of the stop book (sell-stops protect a long, buy-stops protect a short), and there are three answers, not two: covered, uncovered, and **unverified** — the broker could not be asked. The third one exists because the pre-existing coverage audit silently skips a symbol whose stops it cannot read, so that symbol simply vanishes from its report; a halt that inherited that would be assuming protection exists at the exact moment it must not.

**What happens when a position turns out to have no live stop.** The halt still halts — it must, because the only alternative was the liquidation that does not work — but not quietly. First the existing coverage audit tries to re-place the stop from the level recorded on that position's own buy order. If that fails, or if the broker could not be asked at all, the position is named in the owner alert with its held quantity and its unprotected value, the alert leads with it rather than folding it in with the orderly case, and the session message and its stored record carry the same list. The desk does not sell the position to protect it: selling on a breach day is precisely the behaviour being removed, and a naked position is an escalation to a person, not an excuse to fire a mechanism that does not work.

**Two measurement defects fixed in the same change, because both were about the breaker comparing things that were never the same object.**

*The cash park was inside the volatility yardstick.* The breaker's threshold is a multiple of how much the held book normally moves in a day. Every other risk calculation on this desk — gross exposure, the three-way book exposure measure, sector gross, the stop-coverage audit, every AI-facing position view — excludes the cash-parking vehicle, because parked cash is not a position. The weighting function feeding the volatility measurement did not. In the archived book the park was 78% of the gross weight that measurement was taken over, which made the breaker's denominator neither the risk book nor the account but a third object nobody designed. It is now excluded, from the configured symbol rather than a hardcoded one. **What that does to the number:** it makes the threshold slightly TIGHTER, not looser — reconstructed on the archived book at real prices, from about -0.75% to about -0.70% of the account. The effect is small precisely because parked cash barely moves, which is worth stating plainly: the exclusion was worth making because a risk measure should measure the risk book, not because it was moving the trip point much. Tighter means the alarm fires sooner, which is the safe direction for a brake, and it is why this needed no decision from the owner.

*The loss being measured was the whole account's, the threshold was the held book's.* The number compared against the threshold was the account's total change on the day — which includes losses realised on positions already closed, commissions and spread, none of which the threshold models. So the breaker could trip, or fail to trip, on movement its own yardstick had never accounted for. The loss is now read off the held positions themselves. But the fix has a second half that matters more than the first: the threshold is not always the held book's. It has three rungs — an explicit configured percentage, the volatility-relative measurement, and a fixed percentage derived from the per-trade risk unit — and the first and third are percentages OF THE ACCOUNT. Feeding the held book's loss to those would have been the identical mismatch pointing the other way, and would have quietly disabled the breaker on a day where everything was sold at a loss and the book ended empty. So the engine now reports WHICH rung produced the limit, and the numerator is chosen to match it.

**Where it deliberately keeps the old, more pessimistic number.** If any holding does not expose a readable intraday change, the account-wide figure is used instead and the degradation is logged. Same if the held book reads exactly flat while the account is down: a broker that omits the intraday field reports precisely that zero, and nothing downstream can tell it apart from a genuinely unmoved book, so a flat read is not trusted to suppress a breach the account-wide number raises. In both cases the account number is the more negative one on any day with realised losses, so the fallback trips sooner rather than later.

**No trip level moved.** The sensitivity multiple is unchanged, the cap is unchanged, the fixed-percentage fallback is unchanged, and no new number of any kind was introduced. Every branch above turns on whether a measurement EXISTS, never on how big it is. The only movement in the effective threshold is the ~0.05 percentage points of tightening that follows arithmetically from taking parked cash out of a volatility measurement, and that is a consequence of removing something that should never have been in there rather than a choice about risk appetite.

**What would have caught this earlier.** Nothing did, for a long time, and the reason is worth recording: the liquidation path was heavily tested and every test passed. They tested that it submitted the right orders, at the right prices, on the right side, with the right write-ahead discipline, skipping the right duplicates. What none of them tested was whether the thing it did was the right thing to do — a limit order that cannot fill on the only day it fires still submits perfectly. The tests are now written the other way round: the strongest ones assert that the breaker places no order at all, at the broker seam rather than on a return value, so a future change that re-introduces selling through some other helper still trips them.

### 2026-09-14 — the work-queue hook was deleting words out of the middle of board item titles

**In plain words:** the hook whose entire job is to hand the next piece of
work back with an accurate description of it was quietly editing the
descriptions. It handed back, verbatim, "Most ideas die inside the machinery
with ed reason (no_order_built)". The real title reads "...with **no
recorded** reason...". Two words had been eaten out of the middle of a
sentence, leaving a fragment. Not cosmetic: a title with words missing reads
as a different item, and a renderer that silently deletes text makes every
message it produces untrustworthy.

**The cause.** Board items can carry their classification inline in the
headline — "DEFECT", "NO RECORD", "TOO STRICT" and three others — and the
title renderer strips those labels out so the owner-facing name stays plain
English instead of shouting a status word. It stripped them as bare
case-insensitive substrings with no word boundaries. "NO RECORD" therefore
matched inside the ordinary word "recorded" and took the first nine letters
of it, leaving "ed". The same bug had a second victim nobody had hit yet:
"defective" loses its stem to "DEFECT" and becomes "ive".

**What was ruled out first, so nobody re-checks it.** The cross-reference
stripper, the snake-case jargon detector and the sentence-end handling were
each checked and none of them touches it; neither does the shell wrapper the
hook runs through. The rewrite happens in one place only — the title tidier —
and only when a class name happens to be a prefix of a real English word.

**The fix and what pins it.** Whole-word boundaries on each label. Thirteen
tests now cover it, the first of them asserting the exact real title that
produced the mangling, character for character, rather than a
similar-looking invented one — a paraphrase would not have reproduced the
bug, because the bug needs the literal letters "no record" followed by "ed".
The rest pair every class name embedded in an ordinary word (defective,
defects, recorded, records, too strictly) against the same name standing
alone as a label, so the stripping still happens where it should and the
next person cannot fix one direction by breaking the other.

**The general lesson, which this desk keeps relearning.** A substring match
on a human-readable word is a silent corrupter. It fails on real data, not on
test data, and it fails by producing something that still looks like a
sentence.

### 2026-09-14 — the trade-picking seat was told to audit the economics seat's logic, and had nowhere to write the answer (item 18e)

**In plain words:** the AI that picks the trades reads a briefing that
includes the economics seat's full six-paragraph reasoning, under a heading
telling it to check that reasoning for logic errors. Its answer sheet had no
box for such a finding — not a field, not a label, nowhere. It was being
asked to do a piece of work with no way to report the result, and
unsurprisingly no answer was ever seen. There is a box now.

**Why this is not the same complaint as item 18's original one.** Item 18 was
opened about BULK: 70% of the briefing was raw earnings prose. That cause is
closed. This is a different defect that happens to live in the same briefing
— not text that says nothing, but text that asks for something the machinery
cannot receive. Bulk you can measure; an unanswerable instruction you can
only find by reading the schema next to the prompt.

**Re-measured before changing anything, because two items on this board
turned out to be already done and one was still asking the owner to approve
something that shipped four days earlier.** The frozen `run_64290730` fixture
through the live `build_user_message`, on origin/main at 1ff4ec1e:
**87,016 chars over 25 sections.** All four filler markers the 2026-09-13
slice removed occur **zero** times, so that fix is genuinely shipped and the
21.9%-content-free finding is genuinely closed. Residual null words across
the entire briefing: seven, every one of them a NAMED absence. Earnings
18,487 (21.2%) · Technical 16,736 (19.2%) · Independent Source Agreement
11,902 (13.7%) · Candidate Ranking 9,836 (11.3%).

**The count came out 1,083 chars ABOVE the 85,933 recorded on 2026-09-13, and
that is not a regression.** The whole difference is Candidate Ranking growing
8,753→9,836, which is item 10's per-drop machine-readable reasons arriving
the same day. Text that states why an idea died is the exact opposite of the
thing this item exists to remove. Worth recording because a naive
size-watching check would have read it as the fix coming undone.

**What was actually wrong, stated so it can be checked rather than
believed.** Read `ReasoningChain` and `PortfolioDecision`. Between them they
carry the seat's seven mandatory chain steps, two optional-per-schema
audit steps, its targets, the constructor's drop list and a prose view. None
of those is a place to say "paragraph four's conclusion is not supported by
the numbers it cites". So the heading was asking for an audit the schema
could not accept. That is a structural claim: it is settled by reading one
class, not by a benchmark, and it stays true regardless of which model sits
in the seat.

**The two honest options, and why this one.** Either give the instruction an
output channel, or stop shipping the six paragraphs. Deleting them would have
been cheaper and would have saved 2,287 chars, but it declines the question
rather than answering it, and the paragraphs are not themselves content-free
— the derivation behind a regime call bears on how much to trust the exposure
target that comes with it, which is the one thing macro is for on this desk.
So: a channel. `reasoning_chain.macro_audit`, optional-default at the schema
layer because every archived log predates it, MANDATORY per the prompt, and
rendered to the Risk Manager as its own labelled row that reads
`[MISSING ... treat the audit step as NOT PERFORMED]` when left blank — the
same pattern the two existing audit steps already use.

**Deliberately NOT `min_length=1`.** Forcing a non-empty string when the
chain is sound is precisely how the fabricated `or "n/a"` placeholders
started on this desk, and `ExitReviewChain` already carries the write-up of
that mistake. The prompt instead asks for one of two real verdicts: name the
error, or say no logic error was found. The second is an answer, not a
placeholder.

**The caveat that has to travel with this, in the owner's own framing.** This
is a PROMPT change and **this desk has no rig able to validate a prompt
rewrite** — the rehearsal rig replays recorded answers into a changed prompt
and passes regardless, which is recorded separately as "the rig cannot
validate a prompt rewrite". So there is no measured improvement here and none
is claimed. The case is the structural one above, and nothing else.

**What could NOT be verified from this worktree, said plainly rather than
rounded up.** The supporting finding that across 56 archived PM calls 27
carried the macro reasoning chain and zero responses ever named a macro logic
error could not be reproduced: the local database is 0 bytes and the live
archive directory is not readable by this account. It is also a modest sample
whose archive ends 2026-09-02. Treat 56/27/0 as **unconfirmed**. It is
corroboration, not the argument.

**Deliberately not done, with the reason.** The `pm_audit_step_missing`
engine advisory was not extended to the new field. It would fire on every
single run until the model starts filling a field it has never been asked
for, turning a real advisory into noise, and the Risk Manager row already
makes a blank one visible to the seat whose job is to notice. Extend it once
there is evidence the field gets filled.

**What is left on item 18, and it is not volume.** Three things: the
`familiarity_bias` grading criterion is still never stated in any prompt
(verified again — the string appears only in the grading harness and in docs,
in no prompt file); the BUY-eligibility section reorder still needs the paid
benchmark; and the OpenRouter key-level spend cap is still unbuilt. Plus the
written open question: does the seat use the new channel, and does using it
change what it decides? Only the paid `--replay-run` benchmark answers that.
Item 18 stays PARTIALLY FIXED.

### 2026-09-14 — item 53 CLOSED: the sliver of a share nobody could protect now gets its stop put back automatically, and it has already done it once for real

**In one line.** Because this broker sells fractions of shares, a position can
end up as, say, 0.3089 of an Oracle share, and the broker will not hold a
lasting protective stop on a fraction — so the sliver sat there unprotected and
nobody was putting the stop back. It now goes back on by itself, every half
hour, and it did exactly that on a real position today.

**What was actually wrong.** Two separate things, and only the second one was
still open by the time this closed.

The first was that the morning routine only *reported* the missing stop. It
noticed the sliver was uncovered, wrote that down, and did nothing about it.
The owner ruled fix-it rather than pick-one-of-three-options, so the daily path
now re-places the stop instead of complaining about it. It does this through the
same single piece of machinery the in-session sweep uses — deliberately one
home, not a second order path — at the level recorded on that position's own
last purchase, and only ever ADDS an order: nothing in it can sell, resize,
cancel or zero a position. If the placement fails it raises an alarm once that
day rather than silently retrying.

The second, and the reason this item stayed open for two days after the code was
finished, is that **the code was not running anywhere.** The morning routine
fires hours before the market opens, and a fractional stop can only be a
day-order, which cannot be placed into a shut market. So the repair had to
become its own separate half-hourly job that checks the broker's published
calendar and only acts when there is a session to act in. Writing that job is
not the same as installing it, and for two days it was written and not
installed. This is precisely how an earlier fix sat dead for ten days — code
that exists, tests that pass, and nothing on the machine ever calling it.

**What closed it.** The job is installed, enabled, and running on a thirty-minute
tick under the desk's own account. Proof that it works is not a passing test —
it is the live journal line from 13:30 UTC on 2026-09-14, where it found 0.3089
of an uncovered Oracle share and placed protective coverage at the stop level
recorded on that position's own buy. Runs after that report every held position
fully covered, which is the state it is supposed to produce.

**What is NOT fixed, and cannot be.** The sliver is still unprotected
**overnight.** This broker accepts a fractional order only as a day-order
(measured 2026-09-01, broker code 42210000), so each re-placement buys exactly
one session and expires at the close. The only two cures are to stop trading
fractions at all — which the owner declined on 2026-09-02, having ratified
fractional trading deliberately — or to close out the fractional remainder of
every position, which is a trading-behaviour change nobody has asked for. This
is therefore a **standing accepted limitation of the broker, not an open
question**, and it should not be re-filed as one. Worst case on an overnight gap
is the whole value of the sliver.

**What would catch the real failure next time.** The failure mode here was never
the trading logic — it was the gap between "built and tested" and "running on
the machine". The unit-drift report flags any service that exists in the repo
but is not deployed, and it reported this one as `undeployed` daily for two
days. That report was working; it was not being read. The lesson recorded for
next time is that an item whose close condition is "it appears in the live timer
list" must not be described as built, because built and running are different
states and only one of them protects money.

---

### 2026-09-14 — the Visa position that "traded through its own stop" never did; the desk's archive was reading a stop that had been retired four days earlier (WORK.md items 35 and 69, both CLOSED)

**In plain words:** our own records showed Visa trading 63 cents below the
price where we said we had a protective stop, with the position still open —
which looks like the safety net simply failed. It did not. The stop had been
deliberately moved lower four days before, and the broker's record proves the
position was protected the whole time. The number in our archive was just
never updated when the stop changed. The genuinely alarming thing the check
turned up is different and worse: on the same evening the desk widened the
stops on the exact three positions it had just decided it wanted OUT of.

**What was checked.** Alpaca's own order history for the account (read-only,
`status=all`, nested), plus IEX minute bars for the day in question and the
archived run database. Not inferred from the desk's logs — the broker's side.

**The Visa sequence, from the broker.** Bought 1 share at 380.33 on
2026-08-27. A stop-limit protective order at stop 374.27 went on 31 seconds
later and stayed live until it was cancelled at `2026-08-31T20:20:29.145Z`; a
replacement at stop 362.58 was created 126 ms after that. So on 2026-09-01 the
live stop was 362.58. Visa's regular-hours low that day was 372.27 — ten
dollars above the stop. The broker was right not to fire. The position was
closed on 2026-09-02 at 378.73 in the deliberate book-wide liquidation, with
its stop cancelled 0.13 s before the sell, which is the cancel-write-ahead
discipline behaving exactly as designed. Visa is not held today.

**Why the archive disagreed.** The `trades.stop_loss` column is written once,
when the trade is opened, and nothing writes it back when a stop is cancelled
and replaced. The desk's *running* logic was never confused — the position
reviewer's `distance_to_stop` on 2026-09-01 was 2.98% against 373.70, which is
exactly the real 362.58 stop, and 362.58 appears in its prompts from that day
on. Only the stored row was stale. Item 69 was the same illusion on Disney: the
reviewer said 4.49% while the archive implied 0.39%, and the broker record
shows Disney's stop had likewise moved from 105.80 to 101.44 — 4.49% is the
correct figure against the real stop. **The reviewer was right in both cases
and the archive was wrong in both cases.** The lesson to carry: the archived
trades table cannot be used to audit stop distance, and two board items were
filed as anomalies because someone did.

**What was ruled out.** A stop that was never accepted, a stop-limit whose
limit was unreachable, and an out-of-hours print — none apply. The orders were
accepted GTC stop-limits, and the low that mattered was a regular-hours print
at 15:57 ET.

**The real finding.** At that one instant, `2026-08-31T20:20:29Z`, the account
cancelled and re-placed the protective stop on exactly three symbols — CMCSA
(25.80 -> 24.98), DIS (105.80 -> 101.44) and V (374.27 -> 362.58). Every one
moved AWAY from price; Visa's entry-to-stop risk went from 1.59% to 4.67% of
entry. Those three are precisely the three names the position reviewer had
asked to REDUCE 48 minutes earlier, each of which
`exit_blocked_inside_atr_noise_band` refused. So the desk's answer to "I want
out of these three" was to give all three more room to fall. None of the three
new stop prices appears in any agent log before 2026-09-01, so this was a code
path and not a model decision. **Which code path is UNVERIFIED** — no local log
from that date survives on this box, and nothing here should be read as
identifying the mechanism. This is filed to WORK.md item 60 (the exit path's
refusal layers), where the over-refusal evidence already lives.

**What would catch it next time.** Writing the stop back to the trades row on
every cancel/replace, so the archive and the broker cannot silently diverge.
That is not built.

### 2026-09-14 — three ceilings that decided how big an order could be existed only as sentences in a prompt; all three are now gone, and two of them were duplicating a limit the desk already derives (board item 62, CLOSED)

**In plain words:** three separate size limits lived nowhere but the text the
sizing seat reads each morning. No setting held them, no code enforced them,
and nobody had written down where any of the numbers came from. Checked one
at a time: one was covering a hazard the desk already prices properly, one
was a second copy of a rule the desk already derives from its own ratified
envelope, and one was a leftover pointing at a rule that had been deleted from
the sheet a fortnight earlier. None of the three could be derived and none of
the three needed to be. All three are deleted.

**The three, and what each turned out to be.**

*(a) The earnings-queued limit — "a name that just filed may only risk one
percent".* This was a term in the seat's own sizing arithmetic, so it shaped
every proposal for a name with a fresh SEC filing. Nothing enforced it. The
one piece of enforcement that exists clamps the resulting position's WEIGHT,
not its risk — a different quantity, at a different number, and the sheet
claimed the opposite. A note under the rule stated that "the engine has always
used 1% when a filing is JUST FILED"; that was false when it was written and
had stayed in the sheet since 2026-09-01. No engine path has ever applied a
risk ceiling to a just-filed name.

Two further things were wrong with it. The event was mis-described: the flag
fires on a 10-Q or 10-K appearing on EDGAR, which for most US issuers arrives
*after* the earnings press release, so the overnight gap the rule was written
to defend against has usually already happened by the time the flag turns on.
And the hazard it actually covers — the desk is holding fundamentals it knows
to be superseded and has not read — is already handled, deterministically and
with a derivation: a just-filed name produces no earnings stance at all, so it
loses that analyst's seat, arrives at the sizing formula with one fewer seat
agreeing, and the agreement schedule (derived from the ratified envelope two
days earlier, items 30/57) prices it a rung lower. Sizing it down again
through a separate number double-counts the same missing evidence.

*(b) The momentum-leader starter sleeve's per-name ceiling.* Prompt text only;
nothing in the code has ever read it. The sleeve exists to let a name in with
only the technical analyst confirming — which is exactly one seat of evidence,
and the derived agreement schedule already prices one seat at its lowest rung.
The sleeve's own stated intent, "a toe-hold you can add to on confirmation",
is what the schedule does: a second confirming seat unlocks the next rung. So
the sleeve figure was a second, tighter, un-derived home for a rule that
already has a first, derived one. Worth noting because it confused people
twice: the desk separately holds a *different* starter number for
sub-floor reward:risk targets, so "starter size" meant two things at once.
It now means one.

*(c) The cash floor.* This one was not a live rule at all. The regime cash
floor it referred to (risk-off / transitional / risk-on rungs) was deleted
from the sheet on 2026-09-01. What survived was a single phrase inside a
worked example, and its number never matched any rung of the rule it was
citing. A cross-reference in the macro analyst's sheet still pointed at the
deleted rule too; that is corrected.

**What was searched, and ruled out by name.** For the earnings limit: Bartov
and Konchitchki (2017, *Accounting Horizons*) for the filing timetable —
"In 1970, the SEC began requiring a quarterly Form 10-Q to be filed within 45
calendar days after quarter-end", since reduced to 40 days for accelerated
filers — which establishes when the flag can fire but says nothing about
position size. Li and Ramesh (2009, *The Accounting Review*) and Griffin
(2003, *Review of Accounting Studies*) on whether the filing date itself moves
prices; neither abstract could be fetched directly (Springer, SSRN and
ProQuest all refuse), so both are relied on only through a fetched
working paper that quotes them: "Examining the market reaction to 10-Ks issued
separately from the EA, Li and Ramesh (2009) find a market reaction only for
the 10-Ks filed at calendar quarter-end. Importantly, Li and Ramesh (2009)
find a more pronounced market reaction to EAs compared to 10-K filings." The
same paper establishes the ordering the desk had backwards: "the conventional
disclosure practice of 'stand-alone' earnings announcements (EAs), which
preempt 10-K filings, is steadily disappearing over time" — steadily
disappearing, but still the majority case, since the paper measures concurrent
releases rising only "from a low of four percent to a high of 25 percent".
None of this yields a position-size number, which is the point: the literature
is about information content, not about how much to risk.

For the sleeve: Concretum Group's position-sizing research, Curtis Faith's
Turtle unit sizing, and the practitioner pyramiding guides (TradersPost,
LuxAlgo, QuantStrategy.io, Titan FX, HeyGoTrade) were all searched and all
ruled out. Every one of them either targets a constant portfolio volatility —
a fund goal this desk has already rejected on mandate grounds — or asserts a
number with no derivation behind it. Importing either is exactly what the
desk's no-arbitrary-numbers rule forbids.

For the cash floor: Vanguard's 5–10% guidance and the retail wealth pages
repeating it (U.S. Bank, SmartAsset, Hennion & Walsh, Beanvest) were searched
and ruled out on goal: every one is written for a preservation or
decumulation portfolio, and this desk's mandate says in its own first
paragraph that it is not a preservation vehicle. It did not matter in the end,
because the rule the number belonged to no longer exists.

**Does anything get sized differently?** Yes, and this is the part that costs
money rather than tidiness, so it is stated plainly. Nothing *enforced*
changes: the weight clamp on a just-filed name, the agreement schedule, the
single-name risk cap, the drawdown halving and every other deterministic gate
are untouched, and no code path that computes an order quantity was edited.
What changes is what the sizing seat is *told*. Before, it was instructed to
cap a just-filed name and a sleeve starter at one percent of equity at risk.
Now it is instructed to size both on the seats of evidence they actually
carry, and the derived schedule's lowest rung is more than double one percent.
So proposals for those two categories can come in larger than they would have
yesterday, bounded by the schedule and by every enforced gate above it. The
desk's mandate treats under-deployment as its largest measured drag, so the
direction is not obviously wrong — but it is a loosening, it was not
separately ratified, and the owner should know it happened before paper
trading restarts.

**What was deliberately not fixed.** The weight clamp behind the earnings flag
carries a hand-typed number in code with no settings key and no derivation of
its own. It is enforcement, not prompt text, so it was outside this item; it
is now the only un-derived number left in this area and it should get its own
review. Nothing was invented to replace it.

**What catches it next time.** The three test exemptions that let these
ceilings sit outside the hand-typed-limit check are removed, so the check
covers the sheet again. Four tests were added: one fails if any of the three
ceilings reappears in the sheet, one fails if the exemptions are quietly
restored, one pins the mechanism the deletion depends on (a just-filed name
must produce no earnings stance — if that ever stopped being true, removing
the earnings figure would have removed a live constraint rather than a
duplicate one), and one pins that fewer agreeing seats really do buy a
strictly smaller position.

### 2026-09-14 — the model exam was still marking against a rule the desk deleted three days earlier, and the reason it was blocked was a contamination that never existed (PM test gate item 8, CLOSED)

**In plain words:** we want to find out which AI model should run the seat
that actually picks the trades. That test was blocked on the board by a
worry that its input data might be dirty. The worry was groundless — but the
test really was broken, for a completely different reason nobody had written
down: the exam paper still had the old answer key. On 2026-09-11 the owner
retired the rule that every trade must promise at least 1.5 times as much
reward as risk. The exam went on marking models on how well they obeyed it.
Running the comparison in that state would have paid real money to discover
which model is best at following a deleted rule.

**What was actually wrong, verified rather than assumed.**

* **Four of the six marks — 0.80 of the score out of 1.00 — hung off that
  retired number.** Only "did it produce valid output" and "did it do
  anything at all", 0.10 each, were clean. A first pass at this called it
  "roughly half"; counting the weights rather than eyeballing them is what
  corrected it, and the same pass corrected "16 prompt changes since" to 25
  commits.
* On the one real trading day the exam is built from, that definition is
  wrong three separate ways. Twelve of the 38 tradeable candidates are
  breakout setups, which the desk now says carry no reward-to-risk judgement
  at all — including NVDA, the single name this whole line of work was
  written about. Three of the five "qualified shorts" the exam rewarded are
  ones the desk refuses outright on a different rule entirely, so it was
  handing out marks for trades the desk would never place. And every famous
  mega-cap the exam penalised as "weak" is in fact a name the desk's own
  rules admit.
* A third mark, "every thin pick names a catalyst", was grading a
  requirement that no longer exists: a catalyst is now required only when a
  trade's payoff cannot be measured at all, not when it is merely thin.
* **The sharpest single case: SLB.** Ten of the twelve breakout candidates
  sit below the retired 1.5, SLB among them at 1.28 — and `docs/OUTCOME.md`
  names SLB that exact morning as the flagship trade the desk WRONGLY
  REFUSED, because a 3x-ATR stop makes 1.29 the best ratio arithmetic allows
  over the hold. The exam was set to mark a model DOWN for making the trade
  the desk's own doctrine says it should have made.

**What the fix does.** The exam no longer holds any opinion of its own about
what makes a candidate qualified. It asks the desk's own admission rules —
the same plain-Python replay of them that already shadows production — and
scores the model on whether it picked names the desk would actually have
admitted. On this day that is 25 of the 59 names read, of which exactly two
are shorts. Nothing in the exam is a number anyone typed; every threshold it
still uses is imported from the live configuration.

**Two marks were deleted rather than reworded**, which is the part worth
remembering: when a rule is gone, a check that quietly redefines itself to
survive is worse than no check. The catalyst-discipline mark is gone
outright. The familiarity mark — "did it reach for the mega-cap it knows" —
is kept as a REPORTED NUMBER worth nothing, because the three mega-caps in
question are all names the desk permits, and failing a model for taking a
permitted trade would be inventing a rule the desk does not have.

**The blocking claim itself was false, and that is the second lesson.** The
item said past benchmark runs "may be contaminated by bad seat data". They
cannot be. Every input the exam uses is frozen on disk — hand-built
scenarios plus one verbatim copy of a real morning session — and no live
analyst is called anywhere in the harness, so fixing a seat cannot reach
backwards into a saved file. The one real fixture was not dirty either:
every seat returned success on that run. The item had sat on the board as a
blocker on a premise that was impossible by construction, while the actual
blocker sat in the code unwritten-down. Nobody had checked; the wording
sounded plausible next to a real spend-baseline contamination that did
exist, and the resemblance was doing the work of evidence.

**What this exam still cannot tell us, said plainly.** The rule that replaced
the floor reads a reward-to-risk worked out from the desk's own measured
price levels, not from the analyst's guessed target. **Not one of the 59 rows
in the frozen fixture carries those levels** — the field did not exist when
the copy was taken — so that number cannot be computed for any name on it,
and no substitute would be the real one. It does not stop the exam working:
nothing on that day is refused by the payoff rule that is not already refused
for having no view at all, so admission is decided by coverage, rating,
eligibility and how many analysts agree, none of which need a ratio. But it
does mean the exam cannot say whether a model reads payoff geometry the way
the desk now does, and nobody should claim it can. A day that WOULD support
that question already exists in the archive — 2026-09-02, where 63 of 64
readings carry the levels and every one of the 34 tradeable candidates has a
computable structural ratio. Capturing it as a second fixture is unstarted
work.

**A stale number found in the same sweep, unrelated but worth the line.** The
plain-Python replay of the desk's rules was still sizing positions off the
conviction bands the trade-picking sheet used BEFORE 2026-09-10 (high
1.5-3.0% rather than the live 2.0-4.0%). Nobody had named it. It changes no
decision about which names are admitted — conviction only sizes — but it did
mean the audit understated how far past the risk budget the admitted names
collectively ask: 47.24% of equity, not the 56.49% they really ask. The bands
are now parsed out of the live sheet by a test, so they cannot drift again.

**What would catch it next time.** The grader's checks are now pinned by a
test that fails if any check name reintroduces the retired floor, and the
admitted set is asserted equal to the desk's own rule replay — so the exam
can no longer grow a second opinion about what the desk admits without CI
saying so. That is the mechanical version of the rule this desk keeps
relearning: a benchmark that hardcodes a number is a copy of the number, and
copies go stale silently.

### 2026-09-14 — the two drawdown systems, set side by side at last: they do not contradict each other, but the shallowest alarm takes the most drastic action, and one of the three has been unable to see since the reset (board item 32, reconciliation half CLOSED)

**In plain words:** the desk has two separate ways of noticing it is losing
money, and nobody had ever written them down next to each other. That is now
done. They do not fight: one cannot block the other, and the order they run
in is defined. But three things came out of the comparison that were not
known before, and one of them matters a great deal.

**The two systems, side by side.**

| | **Loss alarms (three of them)** | **§11.2 de-levering ladder** |
|---|---|---|
| What it measures | The account's return over a window: today, the last 5 sessions, the last 20 | How far the account is below its own best-ever equity (peak-to-trough) |
| Against what basis | A multiple of the normal daily move of the book *actually held*, rebuilt every session from the holdings' real price history at their real weights, scaled by √(window) | Fixed percentages of the high-water mark: -8%, -15%, -20% |
| What it does when it trips | **Daily: force-liquidates every position and abandons the session.** 5-day/20-day: halves the size of every new BUY and SHORT | Cuts the gross-exposure ceiling to 1.5x, then 1.0x, then 0.5x, trimming the held book to fit; alerts the owner at -20% |
| Can it see today | Daily: **yes** — it reads live broker equity. 5-day/20-day: **no** | Yes, but against a one-day-old high-water mark |

**FINDING 1 — the severity is inverted between the two systems, and this is
the one worth arguing about.** The alarm that trips soonest takes the most
violent action. The daily circuit breaker fires at roughly a 3-sigma session —
about a 3% loss on a book that normally moves 1% — and its response is to sell
the entire book at market and abandon the session. The ladder's *deepest* rung
is a 20% peak-to-trough drawdown, an incomparably worse state, and its
response is only to halve the allowed exposure. So the desk's most drastic
deterministic action is attached to its shallowest trigger. That is not an
inconsistency in the arithmetic; it is a risk-appetite ordering, and it is
therefore the owner's to keep or change, not an agent's. It is recorded here
because it was not visible anywhere before the two were written down together,
and because the boardnote's phrase "loss alarm" understates what the daily one
does — it is a liquidation, not an alarm.

**FINDING 2 — the daily breaker's threshold shrinks with deployment, and its
response is liquidation. The failure mode the owner rejected on 2026-09-11 can
re-enter through this door.** The volatility yardstick weights holdings as
fractions of *equity* and deliberately does not renormalise them, so a book
that is 5% deployed reconstructs a normal daily move about 5% the size of the
same basket fully deployed, and the threshold tightens to match. That property
is intended and is right for a *brake*. Attached to a *liquidation* it reads
differently. A book holding one name at 5% of equity, that name moving 2% on
an ordinary day, produces a daily limit of about 0.3% of equity — which that
one position reaches by falling 6%, an unremarkable single-stock day. The
response is to liquidate the whole book. The desk is in exactly that state
right now: paused, mostly cash, about to ramp.

Two things make it worse than the arithmetic alone suggests:

- **The numerator and the denominator do not measure the same book.** The
  threshold is 3 sigma of what is *still held* at the moment of the check. The
  loss it is compared against is the account's whole-day P&L, which also
  contains realised losses on positions *closed earlier that day*,
  commissions, margin interest, and the spread paid on entries made that
  morning. None of those shrink with deployment and none of them appear in the
  yardstick. During a ramp from cash they are the dominant term.
- **It hides its own trace.** Once the breaker liquidates, the book is
  all-cash, the yardstick becomes unmeasurable, and the limit reverts to the
  6.7% fixed fallback. An operator looking afterwards sees a wide limit and no
  obvious reason the desk sold everything.

This is a genuine failure toward *trading*, not away from it: forced selling of
a healthy book at a 0.3% loss realises losses and pays a round trip. It was
NOT fixed here, because every available fix is either a trip level (the
owner's) or an invented floor (forbidden). It is written as an open question
below.

**FINDING 3 — the 5-day and 20-day brakes are blind, and will stay blind for
6 and 21 sessions after the desk restarts.** They read the `daily_pnl` table
by position — the 5-day return needs a sixth row, the 20-day a twenty-first.
That table is written only by an evening pipeline run, so a paused desk accrues
nothing; the live table has held one row since the 2026-09-02 reset. With
fewer rows both returns come back as "no value", `in_drawdown` stays false, and
nothing anywhere said the brake could not see. **This is not the same
"currently blind after the reset" the 2026-09-04 note recorded** — that was
mis-scaling, and the 2026-09-11 basis change fixed it. This is genuine absence
of data, and the honest response is to say so, not to invent a reading. The
brakes' *only* action is to halve new BUYs, so blindness here costs no
protection that the daily breaker and the ladder are not already providing.

**What the comparison did NOT find, stated because it was the thing most
worth looking for.** The two systems cannot contradict each other:

- A tripped daily breaker cannot block the ladder's de-levering. `check()`
  returns an empty violation list for SELL and COVER before any rule runs —
  exits fail open, entries fail closed.
- They cannot double-sell the same shares. In the morning path the ladder runs
  first, refreshes the broker snapshot after its fills, and only then is the
  daily breaker evaluated against the refreshed positions.
- The 20-day brake cannot be asleep past the point the ladder halves the book:
  all three alarm thresholds are capped at the ladder's -20% owner-alert
  point, and the 5-day threshold is additionally clamped to the 20-day one, so
  |1-day| ≤ |5-day| ≤ |20-day| ≤ 20% holds at every volatility.
- The √time scaling IS applied consistently: one sensitivity, scaled by
  √1, √5 and √20, and the fixed fallbacks (1.34, 3, 4 × the 5% risk unit)
  stand in the same √time relation with the 20-day one clipped by the ladder
  cap. No second convention was found anywhere.

**Every multiple in either system, and where it actually came from.** None was
changed; the point of the list is that it exists.

- `drawdown_vol_sensitivity = 3.0` — **INVENTED, and correctly labelled so.**
  An owner risk-appetite decision of 2026-09-11. A real search that day found
  no published convention for "N multiples of recent volatility trips a
  drawdown alarm". Flagged provisional in five places. Not a defect.
- `daily_loss_risk_multiple = 1.34` — the fallback only. Derived by √time from
  the 5-day multiple (3 × √(1/5)). The *relation* is sound; the anchor is not.
- `drawdown_5d_risk_multiple = 3` — **INHERITED, never derived.** The anchor
  everything above rests on. It came in as "3 losing max-size trades in a
  week" from an April-2026-era constant and has never been validated.
- `drawdown_20d_risk_multiple = 4` — not a derivation at all. It is the ladder
  cap divided by the risk unit (20 ÷ 5). √time would have put it at 6.
- `GROSS_LADDER` rungs -8% / -15% / -20% and 1.5x / 1.0x / 0.5x — a ratified
  owner table. No derivation is recorded for the rungs or the multipliers, and
  none was found. Six invented numbers, ratified rather than derived.
- `DRAWDOWN_BUY_SCALE = 0.5` (halve new BUYs in drawdown) — inherited, no
  derivation recorded.

**What was actually changed, and it is deliberately small.** Neither change
moves a trip level.

- **A volatility yardstick could outlive the session it was measured in.** The
  measurement is memoised because the daily breaker fires from six places a
  session. The comment on the memo said it was keyed on the holdings, their
  weights, "and the latest bar date seen". It was not — the date was never in
  the key, and `src/scheduler.py` holds one pipeline object for the life of
  the process, so the memo outlives a day. A book whose weights rounded to the
  same 4dp on two consecutive days would have priced today's alarms against
  yesterday's volatility, silently, under all three of them. The key now
  carries the trading date, and a clock failure forces a re-measurement rather
  than reusing anything. Low probability, but it was a comment asserting a
  protection that did not exist on the risk path.
- **A blind brake now says it is blind.** The Portfolio Manager's prompt
  rendered an unmeasurable window as "Trailing 5-day return: None%", which a
  model reads as a number near zero — that is, as an all-clear. It now states
  that the window is not yet measurable, how many sessions it needs, how many
  are on record, and that this must not be read as zero. The threshold it
  would fire at is still printed.

**Two open questions, both named rather than closed.**

1. **The daily breaker's tightness during the ramp (Finding 2).** *What would
   settle it:* a decision by the owner on either half — whether the
   liquidation response belongs on the *daily* alarm at all, or whether the
   volatility yardstick should be measured on the deployed book rather than on
   equity when the response is liquidation rather than a brake. Both are risk
   appetite. What would NOT settle it: inventing a minimum threshold, or
   fitting the sensitivity to this desk's own record. Searched and ruled out:
   there is no published convention for a volatility multiple that triggers
   liquidation as opposed to a size reduction — the 2026-09-11 sweep found
   none for the alarm case either.
2. **The inherited anchor `drawdown_5d_risk_multiple = 3` (and with it the
   1.34 derived from it).** *What would settle it:* a published study of
   rolling-window loss thresholds expressed in risk units, or a derivation
   from the desk's own measured per-trade risk that does not read its equity
   curve. Backtesting against this desk's 53-row archive is fitting and
   settles nothing; it is named only to be ruled out.

**What would catch a regression.**
`tests/test_drawdown_vol_relative_brake.py` gains two: that a yardstick
measured on another date is never served to today's alarms, and that an
unmeasurable rolling window is stated in words rather than printed as a null.
The existing 55 in that file and the 11 in
`tests/test_drawdown_brake_rescale.py` are unchanged and still pin the basis,
the √time relation, the ladder cap and the severity ordering.

**Still open on board item 32, and it is the owner's alone:** whether the two
systems should be merged into one drawdown response or deliberately kept as
two. Nothing above answers that, and nothing above depends on the answer. The
standing recommendation is unchanged — keep them separate until there is real
drawdown data, because merging them is a redesign, not a repair.

### 2026-09-14 — item 10 closed: every way an idea can die inside the machinery now records why, and a test now fails if someone adds a new way that does not

**In plain words:** most trade ideas the desk has never reached the market —
they stopped somewhere inside our own software, and for the largest group of
them nothing anywhere said why. Earlier the same day six of those silent
stopping points were fixed and the work was reported as complete. It was not:
checking it properly turned up more, including one whose message the
reason-recorder could never read at all. All of them now record a short
machine-readable code plus a sentence, per stock. More usefully than any of
the individual fixes, there is now a test that fails the moment somebody adds
a new way to drop an idea without recording a reason — this defect had come
back three times, each time after a list of fixes believed to be complete.

**The claim that was attacked, and why.** The board item said the specific
historical cases could not be explained "until the desk trades again". That
same "wait for live data" framing had already been wrong once on this item and
was settled statically instead. It was wrong a second time. Two things were
done with no new trading at all:

**1. The real constructor was replayed over real recorded sessions.** Every
Portfolio Manager target the live desk wrote between 2026-08-18 and
2026-09-02 — 73 targets across 20 decisions, with the technical analyses, the
seat-stance registry, the held book and each session's own equity, all read
out of the production archive — was run through the real
`PortfolioConstructor.construct_orders`. Nothing was stubbed. 68 of those
candidates produce no order, and every single one of them comes out carrying
either a named data fault or a named refusal, with a non-empty detail. Those
are the two records `pipeline_stages._record_constructor_drops` reads BEFORE
it falls back to the generic row whose detail is scraped out of log prose.
The frozen inputs live in `tests/fixtures/constructor_drop_paths_archive.json`
so this is re-runnable, and the built-order set per session is pinned
alongside, which is how "no refusal behaviour changed" is checked rather than
asserted: the same candidates are dropped and the same ones kept.

**2. Every drop site was enumerated from the source, not from memory.** An
AST scan of `src/portfolio_constructor.py` lists every statement that ends a
candidate — a return of no order, a `continue` in the target loop, the sector
dial's negative-allocation refusal — and requires each to either record the
reason itself or carry a `# drop-reason:` comment naming what records it
instead. That is the standing guard, and it is worth more than any of the
individual fixes because it covers the paths nobody has hit yet.

**What the enumeration found that the morning's pass missed.** Nine more
sites. Eight of them were never invisible — their log line does match the
recovery regex — but a matched sentence is not a code: they all landed in the
database under the single generic reason `constructor_dropped` with a
paragraph of prose, indistinguishable by machine from each other. Those eight
are the no-structural-target refusal (twice, once in each builder and once in
the shared entry/stop resolver), the terminal "no valid stop against entry"
check, the wrong-side-of-entry stop refusal, the unmeasurable-geometry
refusal, the non-finite stop and non-finite entry guards, and both ends of the
§10.3 sector-crowding dial. The ninth is the one that matters for the
completeness claim: **no stop typed and no ATR to derive one from** logs
"Constructor: BUY SYM has no stop ..." — the recovery pattern requires
rejected/refused/skipped straight after the symbol, so a candidate dropped
there reached the record as the literal "no matching constructor log line
captured". That is the exact signature the morning's pass had reported as
fully eliminated.

**Stated plainly, because it limits the finding:** none of those last three
guards is reachable through `construct_orders` as the code stands today. A
missing or unreadable volatility reading makes the target derivation file a
data fault one step earlier, and a non-finite stop fails the `> 0` test in
`_resolve_stop` and is replaced by the instrument's own noise band. They are
defence in depth, and a test pins both the code they file and the fact that
nothing currently reaches them, so the day a change opens one up the record
already says what it will say. The other six additions are on live paths.

**The 16 historical rows, attributed.** The census restricted to proposals
after the limit-is-ceiling fix gives 28 proposals, 3 filled, 25 blocked, 16 of
them `no_order_built`. They were attributed by checking out the constructor as
it stood on each row's own date and running it against that session's recorded
target and technical analysis — the day's own code, the day's own inputs.
Eleven of the sixteen reproduce exactly and identically: `CRM` twice, `NVDA`,
`ONDS` and `MP` (2026-08-28), `NVDA`, `VLO`, `PATH` and `DE` (2026-08-31),
`NVDA` and `ZS` (2026-09-01) were all refused by the reward:risk floor applied
after the stop is widened past the noise band — the setup only qualified on a
stop tighter than one ordinary day's range. The five of 2026-09-02 (`MU`,
`CMCSA`, `DIS`, `V`, `AUGO`) are target-derivation and reward:risk refusals of
the same family: no structural level in the trade's direction for `MU`, `V`
and `AUGO`, a sub-floor ratio against the shipping stop for `CMCSA` and `DIS`.
Confidence is lower on those five — the live quote each was priced against was
never persisted, and the replay reproduces only two of that session's four
real orders when the analyst's own entry is substituted for it.

**So the sixteen say something different from what the item assumed.** Not one
of them came from a silent path. Every one of them logged a reason the
recovery regex would have matched; they are anonymous in the database purely
because the capture that writes those reasons to a table did not exist until
2026-09-03, after all sixteen. The rows themselves stay unexplained in the
database — nothing retroactively writes a row for a session that has already
run — and that is a fact to record, not an open question.

**One correction to the numbers.** The full-history census reads 65 proposals,
14 filled, 51 blocked, and machinery ABSENCE (`no_order_built` 18 +
`order_not_placed` 9 + `qty_zero` 3) is **30 of the 51, not 27**. The
post-fix-window figures — 28 / 3 / 25 with `no_order_built` at 16 — reproduce
exactly.

**What would catch it next time:** the AST guard. Every previous pass at this
defect shipped a list of sites believed complete, and every one of them was
wrong about a site nobody had thought of. A list cannot be trusted; a scan of
the source can be.

### 2026-09-14 — the ladder that decides how big a trade can be was five invented numbers, four of which did nothing; it is now one formula with no invented number in it (board items 30 and 57, both CLOSED)

**In plain words:** the desk lets a trade risk more of the account when more
of its five analysts agree. The amount allowed at each level of agreement was
a list of five numbers somebody typed — 3%, 4%, 5%, 5%, 5%. Two things were
wrong with it. Nobody could say why 3 rather than 2 or 4. And because the
desk's absolute per-trade limit is 5% and the decision-maker is separately
told never to ask for more than 4%, four of those five numbers could not
reduce anything at all — they were decoration. Only the first one, the 3%
that prices roughly two thirds of everything this desk sizes, ever did any
work.

Those five numbers are gone. In their place is one line of arithmetic:

> the risk a trade may take is the desk's own ratified per-trade limit,
> scaled by the square root of (how many analysts agree ÷ how many analysts
> there are).

Nothing in that sentence was invented here. The per-trade limit is the 5% the
owner ratified. The analyst count is five because the desk has five seats.
The square root is the shape published research gives for this exact
situation. There is no third number to choose, and that is the point.

**What it produces:** 2.236% at one agreeing seat, 3.162% at two, 3.873% at
three, 4.472% at four, and the full 5% only when all five agree. Every rung
is now a different number, every rung below the top genuinely narrows the
trade, and unanimity — the strongest evidence this desk can ever assemble —
is the only thing that earns the whole envelope.

**Both items were the same object seen twice.** Item 57 asked what the risk
ceiling should be at each level of agreement. Item 30 asked whether a ladder
nobody derived should be pricing size at all. They are answered together or
not at all, and they are answered together here.

---

**Was the "four rungs cannot bind" claim still true?** Yes — re-verified
against the live config today, not taken from the item text. Two things had
moved since the claim was written and both were checked. PR #348 (merged
2026-09-13) touched this area but left the five values untouched; it only
rewrote the comment above them. The Portfolio Manager's conviction bands were
restored 2026-09-10 and top out at 4.0% risk for a high-conviction idea. So
against a 5% hard cap and a 4% top band: rungs 3, 4 and 5 all read 5.0 and
could narrow nothing; rung 2 read 4.0 and could only bite a request the
prompt already forbade. Only rung 1 could ever cut a position, and only over
the 3–4% slice. The premise held.

**Was the measurement quoted beside the numbers a derivation?** No, and the
config comment admitted as much. It counted, against production logs
2026-08-25 to 08-28, how OFTEN each rung is reached — 67% of opening or
increasing targets carried exactly one aligned seat (always technical), 29%
two, 4% three, none ever four or five. That is coverage. It says where the
ladder bites; it never said what a rung should be. It is kept in the config
comment for what it genuinely is — the best description of where this
schedule actually applies — and is no longer offered as a justification.

---

**The derivation, and every source it rests on.** Both academic and vendor
literature were searched, because a previous research item on this board
failed by searching only vendor documentation.

1. **Independent estimates of one quantity combine as 1/N in variance.**
   Fetched: "Optimal blending of multiple independent prediction models"
   (PMC9998929), which states the bound for N independent models with
   variances at most σ²_M: *"if we combine infinite independent models with
   distributions Ri~N(0,σi²), where variance σi² ≤ σM², we get variance:
   σB² = … ≤ limN→+∞ σM²/N = 0"*. Variance falling as 1/N means the standard
   error of the consensus falls as 1/√N — so how much of the consensus you
   can believe rises as √N. That is the whole shape, and it is a statistical
   result, not a market claim.

2. **The applied statement of the same thing.** Fetched: Hyndman &
   Athanasopoulos, *Forecasting: Principles and Practice* 2nd ed. §12.4 —
   *"combining multiple forecasts leads to increased forecast accuracy"* and
   *"using a simple average has proven hard to beat"*.

3. **Finance already prices this as a square root of independent
   estimates.** Fetched: AnalystPrep's CFA Level 2 notes on Grinold's
   fundamental law — *"IR\* = IC × √BR"*, with breadth defined as *"the
   number of independent estimates of exceptional returns made at a given
   frequency in a year"*, and the square root *"indicating diminishing
   returns as you increase the number of opportunities"*. The **mandate
   check** matters here and was done: Grinold's law is a fund-level
   statement about a manager's information ratio, and this desk is a single
   account, not a fund. What is taken from it is the SHAPE — √(independent
   estimates) — and explicitly not its constants, its objective, or any
   portfolio-construction machinery. A CTA-style portfolio-volatility
   overlay was rejected on those same grounds earlier and stays rejected.

4. **Does agreement earn anything at all?** This was item 57's underlying
   question and it now has a published answer in the right direction.
   Fetched: Diether, Malloy & Scherbina, "Differences of Opinion and the
   Cross Section of Stock Returns", *Journal of Finance* 57(5), 2002 —
   *"We provide evidence that stocks with higher dispersion in analysts'
   earnings forecasts earn lower future returns than otherwise similar
   stocks."* Disagreement among independent forecasters on one name is a
   negative. That does not license a number, and none was taken from it —
   it licenses the direction the ladder already runs in.

5. **Vendor / practitioner side, searched as required.** Rob Carver's
   forecast diversification multiplier is the same object in a live sizing
   system: combining several forecasts weakens the combined signal, so it is
   multiplied back up, and for uncorrelated forecasts that multiplier is the
   square root of their number. Carver's own blog (`qoppac.blogspot.com`)
   could not be fetched — Google interposed a consent page — so the
   secondary summary at `the7circles.uk` was fetched instead and quoted:
   *"As less than perfectly correlated assets/rules are added to the
   portfolio/set of rules, the volatility will fall."* Treated as
   corroboration that the shape is in production use, not as the derivation.

**Searched and NOT used, by name, so nobody repeats it:**
Ludger Hentschel, "The Limits of Diversification" (2026) — directly on point
for how positive correlation between signals caps the √N benefit, but the PDF
returned 404 on every fetch attempt, so nothing from it is relied on and the
correlation caveat below is argued structurally rather than cited.
Goldman Sachs Asset Management, "How to Combine Investment Signals in
Long/Short Strategies" — 403 Forbidden, not fetched, not used.
Grinold (1989) in the *Journal of Portfolio Management*, and the JOIM and
NYU reproductions of it — all paywalled or unreadable PDFs; the law is cited
through the fetched AnalystPrep notes instead, which is a secondary source
and is labelled as one.
Bates & Granger (1969) and the Wang & Hyndman forecast-combination review —
correct subject, but their content is about optimal WEIGHTS between forecasts
of differing quality, which is a different question from how a consensus
scales a position, and neither PDF was machine-readable anyway.
**This desk's own trading record** — one live trade and ~53 archived rows.
Ruled out on principle, not on availability: fitting a constant to the desk's
own outcomes is forbidden here and there is nothing to fit to even if it were
not.

**The caveat, stated rather than buried.** √N is the credit for genuinely
INDEPENDENT estimates. These five seats read overlapping public information,
so their errors are certainly correlated and the true credit is smaller than
√N. That makes this schedule the loosest defensible one rather than a tight
one, and it errs toward the ratified envelope, which is separately hard-
capped. It is deliberately NOT tightened by a guessed correlation number,
because guessing one would be exactly the invented constant this replaces.

---

**What actually changes in the desk's behaviour.** Every rung is now lower
than or equal to what it was, so this can only reduce position sizes, never
raise one. The rung that matters is the first: a target with one net
agreeing seat is capped at 2.236% risk instead of 3.0%, a 25% reduction, and
the coverage count says that is about two thirds of everything this desk
sizes. Concretely, at a $30-per-share stop on a $100 stock and a $100,000
account, a single-seat idea that used to be built as a 10.00% position is now
built as a 7.45% one. Rungs 2 through 5 now bind where they previously could
not: two seats 3.162% (was an unreachable 4.0), three seats 3.873% (was an
inert 5.0), four seats 4.472% (was an inert 5.0). Nothing about which trades
are ALLOWED changes — this ceiling only ever narrows a size, and the
refusal at zero or negative net agreement is untouched.

**Why this cannot rot the same way twice.** The five numbers are no longer
storable independently of the cap that constrains them. `RiskConfig` derives
the whole schedule from its own `max_position_risk_pct` when the key is
absent, a test recomputes the shipped `config/settings.yaml` list from that
file's own cap and fails on any hand-edit, and a further test pins the curve
to `cap × √(n/seats)` so a future edit that quietly reshapes it (linear, or a
fudged exponent) fails rather than passes. Move the 5% envelope and every
rung moves with it. A rung creeping up to equal the cap and going inert —
the exact failure items 30 and 57 described — is now unrepresentable.

**What was deliberately NOT done.** Item 30's original question — porting the
ranking path's per-seat weights onto the sizing path — stays refused, for the
reason already recorded: a per-seat sizing weight may only come from measured
history, there is none, and the owner scoped the 2026-09-03 published-prior
amendment to the ranking module. Nothing here weights one seat above another;
all five count 1. The ladder was also not deleted, and not switched off. Both
were live options and both were rejected on the same finding: agreement does
have published support as a signal, so collapsing the ladder to the hard cap
would have thrown away a real effect to avoid deriving a number.

---

### 2026-09-14 — item 66 closed: the swap rule could sell a healthy position because the specialists who liked it had moved on, not because anything about it got worse

**In plain words:** the desk scores an idea by adding up what each specialist
covering it says. More specialists behind the same call means a higher score,
which is deliberate — agreement across independent sources is the desk's whole
edge. The problem was that the desk then used those totals to answer a
different question: "should I sell what I hold to make room for this?" A stock
you have owned for a while is usually covered by fewer specialists than a
brand-new idea, because a new idea typically shows up precisely when something
fresh appears — an earnings filing, a confirmed institutional purchase. Six
weeks later the filing is stale and only the chart still covers the holding.
Its total drops by a third with nothing about the company having changed, and a
new name clears the "must be 25% better" bar to displace it. The desk would
have sold a position for the crime of being old news.

**Three things were checked before anything was changed, and one board claim
turned out to be wrong.**

1. The score really is a sum now (changed 2026-09-13, correctly — the average
   it replaced made a second AGREEING specialist LOWER a name's rank). Not
   undone here.
2. The swap rule really does compare a held name against a new one on that
   score, and it scores the held name with TODAY's coverage, not the coverage
   it had when it was bought. So the decay is live in the comparison, not
   frozen at entry.
3. **The board said the 25% margin is a ratio, so the change from average to
   sum "does not affect it." That is wrong.** A ratio survives a change of
   units. This was not a change of units: the divisor the sum deleted is each
   name's OWN specialist count, and those differ between the two names being
   compared. Two names' totals stopped being comparable term-for-term the
   moment their coverage differed. Worked example, in the desk's own
   arithmetic: an identical top chart read on both names scores 2.4 each; the
   new name additionally carries a live filing and a confirmed flow, taking it
   to 4.0; 4.0 clears 2.4 x 1.25, and a sale is proposed on a name whose only
   fault is that its calendar moved.

**Is it actually reachable? Yes, and faster than the board assumed.** The
board described this as a weeks-long earnings-calendar effect. Measured
against the desk's own archive (17 Aug – 2 Sep 2026, the specialist-evidence
table, five held names), the set of specialists carrying a directional read on
a HELD name changes **day to day**: DIS, MSFT and V each fell to zero scoring
specialists on individual sessions and recovered within days; RSG went from
zero to one to two inside five sessions. Coverage churn is a daily fact of
this book. Two caveats stated rather than glossed: the archive ends 2026-09-02,
before the sum landed, so this measures coverage churn and not scores under
the new rule; and the earnings seat's scoring verdicts are recorded in a
different shape than its analyses, so its contribution to a given day's
coverage could not be reconstructed exactly.

**One thing the board overstated in the other direction.** Automatic rotation
being switched on does NOT mean this comparison can sell on its own. Only the
categorical tier — a holding that fails the desk's own entry rules outright —
is ever turned into a sale, and the reason builder refuses the ranked tier by
raising. The ranked comparison reaches the Portfolio Manager as text in its
prompt. That is still a real path to a real sale, just a model-mediated one,
and it was worth fixing on those terms rather than on "it can sell by itself".

**The fix, and why it needs no number.** The ranked comparison now re-runs the
identical weighted arithmetic over only the specialists that scored BOTH names
— the overlap of their coverage — and requires the same 25% margin to clear
there as well as on the totals. A term that exists on one side and not the
other cannot enter a comparison between the two. Nothing was invented: the
specialist weights, the conviction scale and the margin are all unchanged, and
a specialist's contribution to the restricted sum is exactly its contribution
to the full one. When the two names share no scoring specialist at all, there
is no like-for-like comparison to make and the rule declines outright — a
missed swap costs an opportunity, a wrong one costs a real position, and the
desk chose that asymmetry deliberately.

**Direction of the change, stated because it must be:** rotation becomes
**less** likely to fire, never more. The new condition is a conjunction with
the old one, so every swap that fires now would also have fired before, and
some that would have fired no longer do. That is a property of the
arithmetic, not an estimate; a grid sweep over coverage and strength
combinations pins it. Breadth is undiminished everywhere else — it still
orders the ranking, still picks which new name is strongest and which holding
is weakest, and still drives the categorical tier in full.

**What is recorded.** A surfaced ranked comparison now carries which
specialists were shared and each side's score over exactly those, and the
Portfolio Manager's prompt states that comparison explicitly rather than only
the two coverage-sensitive totals — so a reader can check which comparison was
actually cleared. The categorical tier's per-symbol sell reason and pipeline
event are unchanged.

**What would still be worth doing, and is NOT open as a board item.** The
board's original suggestion — once rotation has run for a while, count how
many swaps were driven by coverage lapsing rather than by signals weakening —
is now largely moot for the ranked tier, because a coverage-only gap can no
longer produce one. If it is ever measured anyway, the shared-specialist
scores recorded on each surfaced comparison are the data to measure it from.

### 2026-09-14 — item 68 closed: the tool that merged the job board had deleted live items three times in one day, and nothing could tell a deleted question from an answered one

**In plain words:** when two people edit the job board at the same time,
something has to combine their edits. The thing doing that lived in a
scratchpad, not in the project, and it followed one blunt rule: if either
side removed something, remove it. That is right when the two people closed
different items and wrong the rest of the time, and it could not tell the
difference. Three times in one day it threw away live questions — five open
items on one branch neither side had closed, and twice two workers happened
to give a new finding the same number and it deleted both instead of asking
for one to be renumbered. Nothing looked wrong afterwards: the file was tidy,
no warning appeared, and a question that had vanished was indistinguishable
from a question that had been answered. That is the exact opposite of this
desk's rule that a question stays on the board until it is settled.

**What replaced it.** A resolver that lives in the project, merges ITEMS
rather than blocks of text, and refuses to write anything it cannot prove is
right. It reads both versions into numbered items per list — the board holds
several independently numbered lists, so the same number is a different item
in each, which is why 4 and 8 legitimately appear twice — keeps the union of
the items, and only drops one when that side genuinely closed it, which it
knows from the common ancestor of the two versions. A number carrying
different text on the two sides is a renumber, never a delete, so it stops
and prints both texts for a person to choose between.

**Why the post-conditions are the actual fix, not the merging.** Every one of
the three destructions produced valid markdown with no conflict marker, so
the existing marker test passed and nothing caught it. Merging better would
have reduced the rate; it would not have made a failure visible. So the tool
now proves its own output before writing: every number on either side is
present exactly once in its own list; the board's own reader
(`scripts/status_board.py`) is asked to read the merged file back and must
report the same items, so the tool and the page the owner reads can never
disagree; no number is both live and retired in the same list; the retired
list is rebuilt as the union of the two source lists, parsed from those lists
rather than scraped out of the sentences around them, which is what corrupted
that line badly enough to need rebuilding from git history; every board note
still has an item to explain; the incident log keeps both sides' entries,
newest first, with existing history not reordered; and the merged backlog is
under the 100,000-byte cap, which main breached twice in one night. Any one
of those failing refuses the write and says which.

**Ruled out, and why.** Hand-resolving: it is the same three files every
time and a person does it worse under repetition. Fewer parallel branches:
the board only clears at this rate because branches run in parallel.
Strengthening the conflict-marker test: it already passed on all three
failures, so it is the wrong instrument.

**What would catch it next time.** The tests that ship with the tool are the
three real destruction shapes — different-item deletions, a same-number
collision, an item vanishing — plus a duplicate, a cap breach and the
append-only log. Refusing is a passing test there. The remaining exposure is
a merge done by hand or by some other tool; the tool being in the project
instead of a scratchpad is what makes reaching for it the easy path, which is
the only enforcement that has ever held here.

### 2026-09-14 — board item 10: "we can't know why most trade ideas die until the desk runs again" was checked, and it was wrong

**In plain words:** most of the time a trade idea disappears somewhere
inside the machinery, nothing on record says why — that bucket
(`no_order_built`) is 16 of the last 25 blocked ideas, 64%, the single
biggest cause of a proposed trade never happening. The board note said this
could not be investigated further until the desk started trading again and
produced fresh examples to look at. That turned out to be false: the
question could be, and was, settled by reading the code, with no trading and
no new data required.

**Why the "wait for new data" belief was wrong.** The mechanism that is
supposed to recover a dropped trade's reason works by scanning the
constructor's own log text with a pattern-matching rule (a regex) looking
for the word "rejected", "refused" or "skipped" right after a stock symbol.
Both the rule and every sentence it is supposed to catch already exist in
the code, unchanged whether or not the desk is trading — so whether the rule
actually catches each sentence is answerable today, by running the real
rule against the real sentences, exactly the way board item 49 (rationed
risk budget) settled its own version of this same question a few hours
earlier without a live run either. Nobody had asked whether item 49's
method applied to the OTHER ~24 places in the same file that can drop a
trade with nothing built. It did.

**What was found — five more places losing the reason, all fixed the same
way item 49 was.**

1. `_plan_risk_targets`'s "agreement ceiling" refusal (a trade an analyst
   liked, but the desk's OTHER analysts collectively disagreed with more
   than they agreed) logged the phrase "produces no order" — the *exact*
   wording item 49 already found the pattern-matcher does not catch,
   present a second time in the same file and missed the first time around.
2. `_build_buy` silently gives up when either the per-trade risk cap or the
   single-name position ceiling shrinks a request down to exactly nothing.
   It does log when it shrinks a request, but never using one of the three
   watched words, and nothing else logs afterward to compensate.
3. `_build_short` — the identical gap, on the short-side ceiling.
4. The portfolio-wide gross-exposure ceiling (a separate module,
   `src/risk/rules.py`) refusing a trade outright — unusable account equity,
   or what little room remains is below the $500 minimum worth trading. Its
   message is relayed through the constructor's own log line, but with the
   RULE'S name sitting between the word "Constructor:" and the stock symbol,
   which is exactly the one shape the pattern-matcher cannot see through.
5. A brand-new position too small to bother opening (below the minimum
   trade-size threshold) got no database row of any kind and no log line
   whatsoever — not a pattern-matching miss, there was nothing to miss.

Every other place in the same file that can drop a trade either already
logs in a way the pattern-matcher catches, or is followed by a SECOND log
line for the same drop that does catch it (so the reason still survives,
just not in the most specific wording) — those were read and left alone,
named here so the check does not need repeating: the "no ATR reading, no
stop at all" branch inside the stop-widening step always falls through to a
second "rejected — no valid stop" line one function up, which does match.

**The fix, and why it is not "a bigger regex".** Widening the pattern to
catch more sentences would have kept the actual defect in place — a trade's
fate living in a sentence written for a human to read, hoping software can
parse it back out later. Instead, each of the five spots above now writes
its reason directly as a structured, named code the instant it happens,
the same way item 49's fix did for the risk-budget case a few hours before
this one. The pattern-matcher is left exactly as it was; the five fixed
spots simply no longer depend on it.

**Verified no trade outcome changed.** Every one of the five fixes adds a
single new line of bookkeeping immediately beside an existing "give up on
this trade" point in the code — none of the arithmetic or conditions that
decide whether a trade happens or not were touched. The full automated test
suite (5,899 tests) passed before and after, unchanged, and six new tests
were added that specifically pin each of the five fixes and prove, using
the actual pattern-matching rule from the code (not a hand-copied version of
it), that the sentences it used to look at for these five cases really were
being missed.

**What this does and does not fix.** From the next time the desk actually
trades onward, these five specific ways a trade can vanish will leave a
named, readable reason instead of a shrug. It does NOT go back and recover
the 16 already-blocked trades sitting in the historical record today — those
happened before this fix existed and their specific reason is genuinely
gone. The five are believed to be the complete list for this file as of this
pass (every relevant spot in it was read and tested), but that belief itself
is checkable the same way: if the "we don't know why" bucket is still
non-trivial after this ships and the desk has traded again, that is the
signal a sixth spot exists somewhere and needs the identical treatment —
run the real rule against the real sentence, do not guess, and do not wait
for more data before checking.

### 2026-09-14 — moved from WORK.md to stay under the byte cap: the 2026-09-01/02 margin-flip handoff, already fully superseded

WORK.md exceeded its 100,000-byte cap after an unrelated audit correction.
This entry was already dead weight there — every warning in it was about
conditions to check BEFORE flipping `allow_margin` to `true`, and that flip
already happened on 2026-09-02 (config confirms `allow_margin: true` today,
2026-09-14). Moved verbatim rather than deleted, per the file's own rule.

**STATE AT 2026-09-01 END OF SESSION — read this before the older handoff below.**

**SHIPPED AND VERIFIED, on `integration/ship-2026-09-01` (tip `af266de`), pushed:**
Phase 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, all five open branches merged, and four corrections to
the rewritten PM prompt. Full suite green: **3,961 passing**, only the two known
`test_rehearsal_reproduces_cost_ceiling.py` failures that read live production
state. **NOT DEPLOYED.**

**PHASE 11's original four-branch WIP state (dispatched, interrupted,
unverified) is superseded below and fully recorded in this file's 2026-09-01
handoff entry** — branch names and per-branch status live there, not
duplicated here.

**SUPERSEDED 2026-09-02 — `allow_margin` is now `true`.** The condition below
was met: the gross cap and the ladder merged and were verified, and the PM
prompt's exposure table moved to 2.0x in the same commit as the flip. Two
things a reader needs that the paragraph below cannot tell them:

- The flip was INERT for longs for its first day. A third ceiling nobody had
  listed — the BUY submit loop's clamp against raw broker cash — held gross
  under 1.0x whatever the setting said. Fixed 2026-09-02; the submit loop now
  draws on a ladder-derived pool. Spec §11.2 carries the detail.
- **2.0x is still not reachable, and that one is the owner's call.**
  `max_total_position_pct: 90` hard-blocks NET exposure, and for a long-only
  book net IS gross: measured, long-only tops out at 0.90x and a long/short
  book at about 1.3x. The standing 2.0x rung and the -8% 1.5x rung cannot
  bind. The PM prompt still asks for 1.60-2.00x on `risk-on`. (Historical —
  `max_total_position_pct` is 200 in the live config as of 2026-09-14; this
  paragraph describes the 2026-09-02 state, not today's.)

The original paragraph, kept for the sequencing it records:

**`allow_margin` is still `false`. It must STAY false** until the gross cap and
the ladder are merged and verified. The PM prompt's exposure table is at 1.0x
cash-only and moves to 2.0x **at the same moment as that flip, never before.**

**THE GATE ON THE 90% SECTOR CEILING.** The owner ratified 90% conditional on
the de-levering ladder being *proven to step*: "The 90% works if you've got the
ladder, so ensure the ladder works." A test must assert the ceiling CHANGES at
each of the four drawdown thresholds, that new exposure is blocked BEFORE any
trimming, and that the ladder is applied EXACTLY ONCE. That test
(`tests/test_gross_exposure_ladder.py`) is in the current suite and passing
(verified 2026-09-14, full run: 5,893 passed, 1 skipped).

**THE LADDER MUST NOT DEPEND ON THE PM RETURNING ANYTHING.** One candidate model
returns an empty book 1 run in 10. At 1.0x that is a lost day; at 2.0x during a
drawdown it means the desk stays levered exactly when it should be shedding. The
ceiling must come from account state, and the TRIMMING path must be engine-driven,
never driven by the PM proposing SELLs. This was flagged "unverified — check in
the code before enabling margin"; margin has been enabled since 2026-09-02 with
no report of the failure mode described here.

**WHAT VALIDATES WHAT — learned the hard way tonight.** The rehearsal rig
**cannot validate a prompt change**. It replays recorded answers into a changed
prompt; measured 23-53% overlap, 23 candidates died before sizing, and the
changed code was never reached. It will pass a broken prompt and tell you
nothing. **Rig validates CODE. The model benchmark validates PROMPT.** Moving the
exposure table to 2.0x is a prompt change and the rig cannot clear it. (This
general lesson is restated as standing doctrine elsewhere in WORK.md; kept
here only for the sequencing.)

**The deploy gate PASSED on the current prompt text** (sha
`96856424b02888879b24a99f25f801faaeb090a8057991840a7d5b4fde154862`, 895 lines).
gpt-5.5 scored 1.000 on all 5 runs against 0.850 on every run of the old prompt,
and the two-position collapse is gone, 0 of 5. **Read that narrowly:** three of
the four checks did no discriminating work, only `actionable_book` separated
anything at 15% weight, and a 1.000 means well-formed and grounded, NOT
profitable. The scenario feeds 30 byte-identical candidates, so it cannot measure
stock-picking and must never be quoted as if it could.

**An uncomfortable finding from the same run:** pick identity there is pure model
prior. gpt-5.5 put 10 of 18 picks into index ETFs where chance is about 2; qwen
picked zero index ETFs in 20. **Which model runs the seat partly decides what the
desk buys before any analysis happens.** An earlier claim that the rewrite cut
index reliance was WRONG — the habit moved from one index to two, it did not go
away.

**Still unbuilt as of that session:** Phase 10.2 (deterministic analyst weighting
in Python), the universe pruning design, and whatever of Phase 11 did not survive
verification. (Whether either is still genuinely open today is not re-verified
by this move — this entry is a relocation, not a re-audit.)

### 2026-09-14 — item 56 narrowed: one number was estimating price targets AND refusing trades, and the "two published rules contradict each other" premise turned out to be false

**In plain words:** when there is no obvious place on the chart to put a stop,
the desk invents one at 2.5 times the stock's average daily range, and a
separate safety check refuses the trade if that stop looks too wide. Two
things were wrong with this, and a third was suspected and turned out not to
be true at all.

The first real problem: the number the safety check used was not written for
that job. It was written to estimate how far a stock could plausibly travel
*toward a price target*, and it was quietly reused to *refuse trades* — the
setting was still called a target setting at the place where it refuses. Two
unrelated jobs, one knob, no derivation on record for either. They are now two
separate settings holding the same value, so nobody can move one and silently
move the other. That is tidiness, not an answer.

The second: the safety check turns out to be almost pure decoration, and it
can now be said exactly how much. It refuses a stop only when that stop has
under a 2% chance of ever being hit during the trade, and as a matter of
arithmetic rather than opinion it can never refuse the desk's own invented
stop at any holding period of three days or more. So the direction of its
error is settled — it is not blocking good trades, it is letting wide ones
through. That is the safer of the two ways to be wrong.

The third was the premise the whole item was filed on, and it was **wrong**.
The item said a well-known trader's rule ("a stop should never be wider than
one day's range") flatly contradicted the desk's own 2.5-times-daily-range
stop, and that the desk had dodged the argument by adopting a third, looser
limit. There was never a contradiction. A stop's width measured in "average
daily ranges" means nothing until you say how long you intend to hold: one
day's range is loose for a three-day trade and very tight for a three-month
one. Restated as the thing both rules are actually about — the chance the stop
gets hit before the trade ends — they land in almost the same place: about 36%
for his rule over the few days he holds, about 37% for the desk's over the
three weeks it holds. The earlier claim that "the desk is placing stops
roughly 2.5 times too wide" compared his *cap* at one holding period against
the desk's *width* at another, and is withdrawn.

**What was ruled out, and why it matters that it was ruled out by name.** The
technique that appears to answer this exactly — Maximum Adverse Excursion,
plotting how far winning trades went against you before they worked — was
rejected, and its own literature says why: excursion statistics describe one
historical sample, and rules tuned to past percentiles inherit the fragility
of any other fitted parameter. That is fitting, which this desk does not do,
and it is unavailable regardless on a record of one live trade and 53 archived
rows. The academic finance literature was then searched separately, because a
previous pass had read only trading-educator and charting-vendor material and
that was the same gap that had stalled item 55. The journals say the threshold
is open work too: the most-cited empirical stop-loss study uses a flat 10% cut
with 5% and 15% run as robustness checks — not scaled to the instrument at all
— and closes by leaving the search for optimal stop-loss strategies to future
research; the one general framework in the field is reviewed as giving little
guidance at the holding periods this desk trades; and the reviewing thesis
sweeps its own level over a 0.5-to-5% grid. Taking any of those numbers would
have been importing a foreign default, which is the same unsourced act in the
other direction.

**What was built instead of a number.** The desk can now state any stop's
width as the probability that stop is touched inside the trade's own horizon.
That reading is not fitted and not chosen: it falls out of two published
results — the reflection principle for the running maximum of a random walk,
and the standard identity relating a day's range to a day's volatility — plus
the stock's own average range and the trade's own stated horizon. It is
recorded on every stop the desk sizes, whether the trade passes or is refused,
so the evidence that would settle the remaining question now accumulates by
itself instead of having to be gone looking for.

**Still open, and deliberately left open (WORK.md item 56):** how unlikely a
stop has to be to hit before it stops counting as a stop. No number was
invented for it, and the check was not switched off and called done. Two ways
out are named in the item, and the second is not a cop-out: either find a
published measurement of stop survival stated as a probability, or accept that
none exists and delete the width check entirely — the desk already answers a
wide stop by buying fewer shares, which is what the published literature
actually prescribes.

**Nothing changed in behaviour.** The value is untouched, the split is a
rename, and the probability is recorded rather than acted on. Nothing here
needed to hold up the restart.

### 2026-09-14 — item 6 was fixed three days ago and the board never noticed; the question it was holding for the owner was never his to answer

**In plain words:** the board carried an open job saying the macro seat's
freshness check was mis-calibrated and that picking its replacement number was
a decision only the owner could make. Both halves were out of date. The check
was rebuilt on 2026-09-11 and the rebuilt version does not have a replacement
number at all, so there was nothing left to decide and nothing left to fix.
The job entry simply outlived the work. Removing it is the whole of today's
change — no code was touched.

**Why it survived.** The 2026-09-11 fix did most of the tidying: it took the
item out of the gate index, added its number to the retired list, and recorded
that the owner's pending question was superseded rather than answered. What it
missed was the item's own detail block further down the file. The result was a
board that listed the item as retired in two places and as open in a third,
with the open copy pointing at a countdown that no longer existed. Worth
naming as a pattern: an item lives in more than one place in this file, and
closing it in the index is not closing it.

**The mislabel, which matters more than the stale entry.** The block said the
replacement freshness number was "a risk-threshold call for the owner." It was
not. How long a government statistics agency takes to publish its own figures
is a published fact about that agency — you look it up, you do not have an
appetite about it. Routing it to the owner would have asked him to guess at
something knowable, and it would have sat on his queue counting down while it
waited. Only money, mandate and risk-appetite questions belong to him. This is
the second time a knowable fact has been queued at him as a threshold call.

**What the check does now, so nobody re-loosens it.** The old rule demanded
that two of the six headline indicators be no more than one day old before the
macro seat was allowed to call a change in market conditions. FRED's daily
series do not publish that fast, so the rule was rejecting healthy data — it
fired on roughly half of all recorded runs. The rebuilt check asks a different
question entirely: is this the newest reading that has actually been
published, and was a newer one due by now and never arrived? It reads each
series' own publication timestamp and works out that series' own normal
publishing rhythm from its own history, so there is no lag number anywhere in
it and it corrects itself when a release schedule changes.

**It did not become permissive.** It still blocks on an indicator that is
missing entirely, on one where the fetch quietly returned less than the
provider actually holds, and on one whose next reading is genuinely overdue by
its own schedule — a feed breaking, a publication failure, a government
shutdown. What it no longer blocks on is data that is simply old because
nothing newer exists, which is the normal state of monthly inflation and
employment figures. A five-week-old inflation print is the current inflation
print.

**Stated honestly, not hidden:** the 52%-of-runs figure was measured against a
production journal that no longer exists in this environment, so it could not
be re-derived today — it is confirmed only as far as the recorded measurement
and the code history go. The one-day bar, by contrast, was confirmed directly
from the pre-fix source. And the rebuilt check has still never been measured
against live production; it was reasoned forward, not validated backward. That
residue was recorded on 2026-09-11 and remains true.

### 2026-09-14 — PM TEST GATE item 4 closed: a stock whose news answer got lost now says so, instead of looking like a quiet day

**In plain words:** on 2026-08-25 the news-reading AI produced a real answer
for AMD, but a formatting slip in its response caused AMD's whole entry to
disappear — its stories got merged into a different stock's entry instead.
Nothing downstream could tell that apart from AMD genuinely having no news
that day, and those two situations call for opposite trading decisions.
Fixing the formatting slip itself was ruled out in the earlier half of this
item (2026-09-03): there is nothing left to safely reconstruct, since the
model's own words for AMD are gone, not just mis-typed. What was still open
is a different, buildable job: never let that loss be silent. It now is not.

**What was built.** Before the news seat runs, the desk already knows —
independently of the AI, from a plain keyword scan of the raw wire text —
which stocks had real headlines shown to it (`NewsDataProvider.
tag_symbol_mentions`). After the AI answers, that list is compared against
the stocks its structured answer actually covers. Any stock that was shown
real coverage and has no entry in the answer is recorded as LOST, not
absent — a presence/absence check, no threshold or count involved, matching
the standing "no arbitrary numbers" rule. This reuses the desk's existing
per-item loss ledger (`AnalysisParseTelemetry.record_dropped_item`, the same
mechanism `tech_analyst` already uses when a batch response comes back
short a symbol), rather than building a second, parallel way to record a
loss.

**What the Portfolio Manager now sees.** A new "News Answer Lost" block in
its own briefing, directly under the ordinary Stock-Specific News section,
naming every lost symbol by ticker and saying plainly that this is NOT an
absence of news and its coverage should be treated as unknown — the same
discipline already used for a seat with no lean ("no lean from: {seat}",
2026-09-13) and for an earnings filing read but not concluded ("read, no
call", item 7). Nothing is invented for the lost symbol — no headline, no
sentiment, no direction — only the fact of the loss.

**Alerting.** `data_status["news"]` gains a new value, `symbol_dropped`, set
whenever this loss is detected on an otherwise-clean run — checked ahead of
the existing `low_confidence` self-report, since a confirmed loss is worse
than the model's own stated doubt. That value already pages the owner
through the standalone data-quality Telegram alert shipped 2026-09-11
(`maybe_alert_data_quality` — any status other than "ok"/"empty" pages, no
new alert code was needed).

**Known, accepted false-positive.** The news prompt explicitly permits the
model to see a stock mentioned in a headline and judge it incidental,
skipping it on purpose ("Only include symbols with genuinely relevant news.
Skip mentions that are just incidental."). That legitimate skip is
indistinguishable, from the outside, from a lost answer, and this check will
flag both the same way. This is a deliberate choice, not an oversight: the
owner's framing for this item was that a real loss read as silence is the
worse of the two failures, so the design accepts an occasional
over-report rather than risk another silent one. If this proves noisy in
live running, the fix is narrowing what counts as "real coverage" going
into the comparison — never suppressing the alert.

**Tests.** New coverage in `tests/test_news.py` (the seat's own detection,
against a mocked response shaped like the 2026-08-25 incident and a control
case where nothing is lost), `tests/test_pipeline_stages.py` (the new
`data_status` value, including priority over `low_confidence`), and
`tests/test_portfolio_manager.py` (the briefing renders the lost-symbol
block, and renders nothing when there is nothing to report). All fail
against the pre-fix code and pass against the fix. Full suite: 5,785 tests
(5,784 passed + 1 pre-existing failure unrelated to this change, see
`test_rehearsal_reproduces_cost_ceiling.py`'s own note about reading live
production state), 1 skipped — no regressions.

**PM TEST GATE item 4 is now fully closed** — see `docs/WORK.md`'s "Retired
item numbers" line.

### 2026-09-14 — the retired-item-numbers line was quietly corrupted, and it was making the corruption worse

**In plain words:** the one line in the job board that says "these numbers are
closed, never reuse them" had been wrong for a while, and being wrong made it
actively dangerous: every branch that opened a new item read that line to
decide the next free number, so a wrong line handed out numbers that were
either already live or already retired for real. Two agents collided on
number 63 because of it. A repair on 2026-09-14 (PR #370) reconstructed the
list from the file's own git history rather than trusting the accumulated
prose, and even that repair immediately collided again.

**What was actually wrong.** A "mis-resolved merge" earlier on 2026-09-13
(the same one item 65's original prose already blamed for wrongly retiring
items 55-59) had also swept several unrelated numbers — 1, 3, 4, 8, 10, 20 —
into the retired list, and separately the list carried 67, 90, 101 and 200,
none of which ever appeared as a real item heading anywhere in the file's own
history. 1, 3, 4, 8, 10 and 20 were, and remain, live open items; 4 and 8 are
legitimately live in both the funnel-queue and PM-test-gate numbering
schemes, which is a separate, correct kind of duplication the corruption was
not distinguishing from its own error.

**How the reconstruction was done, and why it is trustworthy.** `git log
--follow` was walked one revision at a time, matching `**N.` item headings
directly rather than regex-scraping numbers out of surrounding prose — the
exact failure mode that caused the corruption in the first place. That
produced a clean base list current as of commit `61871c0d`, missing only the
closures that landed on `main` after that snapshot (items 15, 31, 58 and 59),
which were folded back in on merge.

**The collisions this forced, in order.** (1) Two branches independently
numbered new findings 62 and 63 at the same time; the corrupted retired list
gave neither branch a reason to expect a collision, and both were restored by
hand as 62-64. (2) A branch documenting the doc-resolver's own item-deletion
bug independently claimed 65, which a different branch's review notes had
already used for an unrelated finding (seat strength scales) and landed
first; renumbered to 68 under the belief — correct at the time — that 67 was
retired. (3) The reconstruction in this very entry showed 67 was never real
and is actually free, but 68 had already shipped under that number, so it
stays; nothing is renumbered backward once merged. (4) A fourth branch (item
60's exit-check fix) independently claimed 68 and 69 for two new findings
while 68 was already the doc-resolver item from (2); renumbered on this merge
to 69 and 70.

**What would catch it next time.** `tests/test_status_board.py` now asserts
the retired list parses as clean integers with no duplicates
(`test_the_retired_numbers_line_parses_as_a_clean_integer_list`) and that no
retired number names an item still live in either scheme
(`test_no_retired_number_names_an_item_that_is_still_live`). Neither test can
catch a *future* two-branch race on the same fresh number — that is a merge-
time discipline, not a static check — but both make the specific corruption
that caused this entry impossible to reintroduce silently.

### 2026-09-14 — the one exit class the ATR noise band actually judges was the one class nobody checked the chart for

**In plain words:** when the desk decides to sell because "the reason I bought
this has been proven wrong", there is a fact that either happened or did not:
has the price actually closed beyond the level the stop was resting on, two
sessions running? The desk works that out. It just never asked, on exactly
those sells. Instead the only thing standing there was a rule of thumb about
whether the move was bigger than an average day. Those are not the same
question, and only one of them is checkable. The check is now consulted, its
answer is written down against the symbol, and — deliberately — nothing else
changed: no sell that is refused today gets through because of this.

**How the gap stayed invisible.** Two separate pieces of the exit path each
looked reasonable alone.

* The noise band looks like a general filter on every discretionary exit. It
  is not. Twenty-one of the twenty-six accepted trigger phrases also count as
  "cites external information", and any reason that does skips the band
  entirely. Each of the twenty-six was run through that predicate rather than
  eyeballed; the five survivors are all thesis-invalidation phrasings. So the
  band's whole non-redundant job is judging thesis-invalidation exits.
* The claim-checker that sits behind the band returns early unless the reason
  claims a regime flip or a bearish news state change. That early return was
  correct on its own terms — the checker genuinely has no branch for a thesis
  claim — but the structural read it was skipping is not part of the checker.
  It is the desk's answer to the very question a thesis-invalidation exit is
  asserting, and it was being skipped along with the checker.

Put together: on the only exit class the band exists for, the desk had a
checkable fact available and threw it away, and answered with a rule of thumb
in a different unit instead.

**What was deliberately NOT done, and why.** Three tempting moves were all
refused. (1) Widening or removing the band — the evidence does not support it:
all eight blocked discretionary exits in the archive independently fail the
named-trigger gate as well, so the band has never once been the reason an exit
did not happen. (2) Blocking a thesis-invalidation exit when the level comes
back intact — that is a real tightening of the sell path and a decision the
owner should take on purpose, not a side effect of wiring up a check. (3)
Filing the new read into the confirmation ledger. This one is the subtle one
and it is the reason the change is safe: a break only lifts protection once
it holds on two consecutive closes, so filing a read from a NEW call site
would let a break confirm a session earlier than it does today, lift
protection a session earlier, and quietly release an exit that is blocked
today. The new read is therefore explicitly read-only.

**What would catch it next time.** The predicate that made the gap measurable
— run every accepted trigger phrase through the bypass and see which ones are
left — is a one-line experiment that nobody had run in the year this code has
existed. Any gate expressed as a keyword list deserves it: list the inputs
that actually reach the gate, not the inputs it appears to cover.

**Also filed today, not fixed.** Two archive discrepancies that need an
account-side lookup nobody here can do (WORK.md items 35 and 69): a Visa
position recorded 63c below its own stop and still open, and a Disney review
reasoning with a distance-to-stop an order of magnitude away from what the
desk's own trades table implies. And one arbitrary-number finding (item 68):
the same underived `1.0` is the noise-band ATR multiple and the absolute
minimum stop width — one round number doing two unrelated jobs, agreeing by
coincidence rather than by construction.

**Moved out of docs/WORK.md today for the 100,000-byte cap — verbatim, nothing
deleted.** Both belong to item 55 and are summarised in place there.

*Item 55, part (c), as it stood in WORK.md:*

**Part (c) is CLOSED — 2026-09-13, second pass.** `MIN_TOUCHES = 2` in `src/data/levels.py` is no longer a convention. Two points are the fewest that can define a horizontal line at all, and the published construction of this exact object uses the same figure: Tsinaslanidis, *Technical Trading Strategies, Pattern Recognition and Financial Risk Management* (PhD thesis, University of Macedonia, 2012 — the published method of Zapranis & Tsinaslanidis 2012a, *Applied Financial Economics* 22(19)), §4.4: "Only price areas (bins) with frequencies greater or equal to two are considered as HSAR." Raising it is excluded by that work's own MEASUREMENT rather than by preference (§4.6.1, 733 NASDAQ/NYSE names, 1990-2010): "results indicate that these 'strengths' play no major role in predicting trend interruptions" — on NASDAQ, two-local levels were hit 26,868 times and bounced 60.99%, three-local levels 6,661 times and bounced 61.04%. Pinned by `tests/test_level_match_zone.py::test_min_touches_is_two_and_that_one_is_sourced`. Do not re-open and do not "tighten" it to 3.

*Item 55, "already searched and ruled out", as it stood in WORK.md:*

**Already searched and ruled out — do not repeat any of this.** *First pass, 2026-09-13, the window:* TA-Lib's `FRACTAL` defaults both arms to 2 with no rationale stated; MetaTrader 5's fractal doc defines five bars and gives no reason; fxssi records that five became standard because it shipped as a MetaTrader 4 default, which is a distribution fact and not a measurement; LuxAlgo's swing reference says outright there is no universally best setting. *Second pass, 2026-09-13, the zone, every source named so nobody re-fetches them:* Osler (2000), *Support for Resistance*, FRBNY Economic Policy Review — the origin of the bounce-frequency test and cited by everything downstream, but it evaluates levels PUBLISHED by six dealing firms and so never has to define a zone width of its own; ruled out as a source for (b). Osler (2003), *Currency Orders and Exchange Rate Dynamics*, FRBNY Staff Report 125 — explains WHY zones exist (stop-loss and take-profit orders cluster at round numbers) and gives no width; ruled out. Zapranis & Tsinaslanidis (2012) / Tsinaslanidis (2012) — the closest match to this desk's construction and the source of everything above; leaves x a user input; ruled out as a derivation, kept as a placement. Bulkowski, `thepatternsite.com/SAR.html` and `/TallCandleSAR.html` — the "thick bands of molasses" phrase originates with him and he quantifies nothing; his tall-candle study reports only "Reversals are evenly distributed over the candle body", which says no sub-location within a bar is privileged but gives no zone width; ruled out. Brock, Lakonishok & LeBaron (1992) — the canonical 1% band in this literature is a whipsaw filter on a moving-average crossover, not a support-zone width, and is chosen not derived; ruled out, and do not treat the coincidence with the desk's 1% as a source. `arXiv:2507.01971` (DeepSupp) — states a 3% figure only as an evaluation tolerance for one metric and derives nothing; ruled out. *Structural facts, settled, not to be re-derived:* the two windows never meet — no module imports both, pinned by `tests/test_pivot_window_independence.py` — and a bar dominating 5 bars either side necessarily dominates 3, so the trailing window sees strictly more. Making both 3 or both 5 was rejected: that is picking a number. Moving `CLUSTER_TOLERANCE_PCT` to the literature's illustrative 3% is rejected for the same reason — adopting a foreign default is the same unsourced act in the other direction. Re-tuning the *match tolerance* against the width was ruled out earlier and the tolerance is instead derived from the width itself (`level_zone_halfwidth`), which made the pair CONSISTENT and did not make the width RIGHT.

### 2026-09-14 — a "three strikes and you're out" rule for repeat trade ideas was REFUSED; the conversion rate turned out to measure our own plumbing, not the stocks (item 10, gating half ANSWERED NO)

**In plain words:** the desk kept suggesting the same stocks and never buying
them, so the obvious idea was to stop it re-asking for a name with a bad
record. The owner rejected that framing outright — "this proposal is a hack,
not a solution" — and told us to settle it ourselves. We did, and the data
says he was right for a reason nobody had articulated: **how often a stock
converts is not a fact about the stock. It is a self-portrait of the desk's
own gates and its own broken plumbing.** Blocking on it means blacklisting a
company for our bug. Answered NO, closed, not deferred.

**The census (re-run read-only over the archive, `scripts/blocked_proposals_census.py`).**
65 entry proposals, 14 filled, 51 blocked. By cause: `no_order_built` 18,
`order_not_placed` 9, `rm_rejected:rr_fail` 7, `order_canceled` 6,
`geometry_rr` 4, `qty_zero` 3, `rm_rejected:other` 2, `insufficient_cash` 1,
`slippage_gated` 1. Machinery ABSENCE is 27 of the 51; real execution or
price events are only 7. Restricted to proposals after the limit-is-ceiling
fix (`0eb4a115`, 2026-08-27 14:18:58Z): 28 proposals, 3 filled, 25 blocked,
`no_order_built` alone 16, and exactly ONE broker cancel.

**VLO is the proof — a gate would blacklist a symbol for a dead defect.**
Two of VLO's three strikes are `order_canceled`, dated 2026-08-21 and
2026-08-27 13:36. The limit-is-ceiling fix landed at 14:18 that same
afternoon, and the comment shipping it names VLO explicitly as the trade it
was written for. Both strikes predate the fix by hours. A conversion counter
has no way to know that; it would have barred VLO for a fault that no longer
exists. The other repeat zero-fill names, JPM and PATH, are the same story:
between the three of them there is not one spread, book or partial-fill
event on record — their causes are `order_not_placed`, `order_canceled`,
`no_order_built`, `geometry_rr`, `rr_fail`. Every one of those is us.

**NVDA is the cost — a gate would have killed the best trade in the record.**
NVDA was proposed 8 times, refused across six distinct causes, and then
FILLED on the eighth — at 2.75% risk and high conviction, the largest and
most confident ask in the whole dataset. Any three-strikes rule kills that
trade five proposals earlier. XLE tells the same story more quietly: 6
proposals, one fill. `docs/AGENT_ROLE_AUDIT.md` §1.6 already recorded that
XLE and NVDA "have each since recorded one fill and are no longer zero-fill
under any count."

**And the input churns daily.** 2026-09-01's offender list was XLE and NVDA;
2026-09-02's was VLO, COP, JPM, XLF, CRM, PATH — no overlap. A gate whose
input turns over completely inside a day is gating on noise. §1.6 also
records the diagnostic UNDER-counts: roughly 7% of sized targets never reach
`specialist_evidence`, plus 10 decisions with no evidence rows at all.

**Why no threshold is needed at all — the reformulation.** Partition the
refusals by cause and every class answers itself. *Deterministic* refusals
(`geometry_rr`, `qty_zero`, `rr_fail`, constructor refusals) re-fire on their
own against an unchanged repeat, in the same session, consuming zero capital
— a counter adds nothing; and a repeat whose geometry has CHANGED should
pass, which is precisely what NVDA did. *Machinery absences* are a bug to
fix, not a name to blacklist. *Execution events* are fixed at the execution
layer, per-order, never per-symbol. The portfolio manager's prompt already
carries the correct shape and a count cannot express it: "re-proposing it
unchanged will fail the same way again — either fix what the reason names …
or drop the name. This is information, not a prohibition." The conditional
on UNCHANGED is the entire content of the rule.

**"Slots burned" was a false premise — verified, not assumed.** There is no
position-count cap in `config/settings.yaml` and no target-count cap in the
portfolio manager; `docs/OUTCOME.md` records position count as "Not fixed.
Determined dynamically by the risk budget." A blocked proposal consumes zero
risk budget, so it burns no slot. Whether a repeat displaces a fresher
candidate inside the PM's own shortlist is UNMEASURED and is recorded as
unmeasured — not asserted either way.

**What is left OPEN, and it is the real finding.** Under current code
`no_order_built` is 16 of 25 blocked proposals — the majority of trade ideas
die inside the machinery — and for every measured row the cause is
**unrecoverable**, because the constructor's drop-reason capture (PR #222,
#226, 2026-09-03) postdates all of them. That capture has never been
measured, because the desk has produced no proposals since. What would
settle it: re-run the census once post-2026-09-03 proposals exist, carrying
the two §1.6 undercounts. Until then, no claim about the cause is defensible.
Tracked as `docs/WORK.md` item 10(a); the gating half, 10(b), is closed.

**The stale label, stripped in four places.** "Owner decision" had propagated
to `docs/WORK.md` item 10, `docs/BOARD_NOTES.md` item 10, the 2026-09-03
entry in this file, and `docs/AGENT_ROLE_AUDIT.md` §1.6. It was never the
owner's decision — he had refused it. All four now say answered.

### 2026-09-14 — the four numbers that describe every chart to every analyst seat were all round figures somebody liked; they are now read off the stock itself (item 58)

**In plain words:** before any analyst seat looks at a chart, the desk writes
it a short description — has this stock gapped, is it going sideways. Four
round numbers decided what got written: a gap had to be at least 2% to be
mentioned, and "going sideways" meant a total range under 8% across 15
sessions with a small net move. None of them came from anywhere. The problem
is not that they are wrong, it is that they mean different things on
different stocks: a 2% gap on a sleepy utility is a real event, a 2% gap on a
high-volatility name is an ordinary Tuesday, and both were reported to the
seats in exactly the same words. Every number in that description is now
measured against the stock's own recent behaviour instead, so there is no
percentage left in it at all.

**What each number actually moved, established before any of it was changed.**
This mattered more than the fix. Nothing in the trading rules reads the gap
list or the consolidation flag directly — no gate, no stop, no size. Both
reach a real decision only one way: they are sentences in the Technical
Analyst's prompt, and that analyst's own `setup_type` verdict *does* move
real machinery downstream (a sizing multiplier, whether the reward/risk floor
applies at all, and how the position is tracked after entry). So the honest
answer is that these constants can change a trade taken or refused in a live
session, but only by persuading a model, never by mechanically refusing
anything. The one place a constant does gate deterministically is the
backtest engine, which substitutes the consolidation flag for the analyst's
chart read; that path does not touch live trading.

**What replaced them.**

* *Gap worth reporting.* Bulkowski's definition of a gap is purely structural
  and carries no size floor: today's low above yesterday's high, or today's
  high below yesterday's low. The detection code was already exactly that;
  the 2% was a second screen bolted on top, justified in a comment as
  "smaller ones are noise that ordinary intraday movement fills within
  hours". That sentence is now the test, measured: a gap is reported when it
  is wider than one ordinary day's trading range for that name — which is
  what ATR is — so ordinary intraday movement demonstrably cannot close it in
  a session. The published prescription is to express gap size in ATR rather
  than to threshold it, so the multiple is now printed on the line and the
  seat can see the significance for itself.
* *Consolidation.* Two tests, neither containing a number. First, the
  trailing window's high-low envelope must be no wider than the envelope of
  the equal-length stretch immediately before it — Toby Crabel's narrow-range
  shape (NR4/NR7: the narrowest range of the last four or seven bars) lifted
  from a single bar to a window, and the same idea as Minervini's volatility
  contraction. It is a comparison against the name's own immediate past, so
  it means the same thing on a utility and on a high-beta name. Second, the
  window must be sideways rather than drifting: the range is spent either on
  net drift or on oscillation, and a base oscillates more than it drifts.
  That second test is arithmetically identical to the old
  `_CONSOLIDATION_MAX_DRIFT_RATIO = 0.5` — the 0.5 turned out not to be a
  tuned cut at all but the break-even point between drift-dominated and
  oscillation-dominated. Behaviour unchanged; only the framing was arbitrary.
* *Window length.* The 15 is now the ATR period the same file already reads
  volatility over. A stretch shorter than one full volatility-measurement
  period has no volatility reading of its own to be judged tight against, so
  there is nothing to compare it to. The window sets a minimum and a
  resolution, not a pass/fail line: the detector already extends the base
  backwards for as long as price stays inside the envelope, so the base
  length that gets reported is read off the instrument either way.

**What was ruled out, by name.** O'Neil's flat base ("roughly five weeks or
more of sideways trade with a correction of no more than about 15 percent")
was rejected because the same source says outright that "Both numbers are
conventions from studies of past leaders, not laws" — adopting them would
swap one convention for another with a citation stapled to it, which is the
same unsourced act in the other direction. Also rejected: picking any ATR
multiple for the gap floor, the move already refused for the level-match
tolerance. The multiple used is one, and one is not a tuned parameter — it is
the identity "wider than an ordinary day". The academic route was searched
too, after the item 55 precedent: the one directly relevant rule-based
recognizer for horizontal/rectangle consolidation patterns is Tsinaslanidis
and Zapranis' 2016 Springer book, whose identification criteria are behind a
paywall and could not be fetched. It is recorded here as unread, not as
unsupportive.

**Known weakness, stated rather than hidden.** A purely relative contraction
test flags dead tape as consolidating, because in a dead market every stretch
is narrow and nothing is coiled. That is a real limitation of the shape and
the usual remedy is to add an absolute floor as some fraction of ATR — a
fraction nobody can source, so it was not added. It bites less here than it
would elsewhere: this flag tells the analyst "range-bound, not breakout",
and a dead stock genuinely is range-bound. The flag would be wrong if it
were read as "expansion is imminent". Nothing reads it that way today; if
something ever does, this is the paragraph to come back to.

**What catches it next time.** A test asserts the three deleted constants
have not reappeared under any name, and another asserts the consolidation
window is still the ATR period rather than a figure of its own. Two more
feed the same percentage gap to a quiet name and to a volatile one and
require opposite answers, which no flat threshold can pass.

### 2026-09-14 — item 49 closed: the desk was choosing which trades to fund by how much they asked for, and nobody had chosen that

**In plain words:** the desk can only risk so much in total — a quarter of the
account. Until 2026-09-11 that ceiling almost never got in the way, because
another rule was throwing out so many trades that there was always room. That
rule was removed for being wrong, and the number of trades the desk is allowed
to take roughly doubled. So the ceiling now binds on an ordinary day: the desk
wants to risk about twice what it is permitted to, and something has to decide
which trades actually get the money. Nothing did. The money went to whichever
trade had asked for the BIGGEST amount — a measure of size, not of quality, so
a mediocre idea asking for a lot beat an excellent idea asking for a little,
every time. The owner's decision was best-ranked first: fund the strongest
idea, then the next, until the money runs out. That is now what happens. A
second, smaller problem was found and fixed alongside it: a trade that missed
out purely because the money ran out was leaving no record at all of why — it
simply vanished off the order list.

**Both halves are now ratified.** The owner settled the ORDER on 2026-09-12
("be ran by the best, why bother with crappy ones if you've got a choice, go
with the best") and the CUT LINE on 2026-09-14. The item is closed; number 49
is retired and is never reused.

**The measured case this was built against.** Run `run-64290730`, after the
reward:risk floor was removed by setup type: eligible names went 12 → 25, and
the eligible set asked for **48% of equity at risk against the 25%
`max_portfolio_risk_pct` ceiling**. Those two aggregates are what was measured;
the per-name split below is arithmetic on their average (48 / 25 = 1.92% per
name), NOT recovered per-symbol data, and is labelled so nobody quotes it back
as a measurement.

Worked through at that average, with the desk's own 0.5% minimum tradeable
size:

- 12 names funded in full at 1.92% each — 23.04% committed.
- The 13th finds 1.96% of headroom left, asks 1.92%, and is funded in full —
  24.96% committed.
- The 14th finds 0.04% left. That is under the 0.5% floor, so it is DENIED
  rather than shrunk to a token position — unchanged behaviour, and the
  reason the floor exists.
- Names 15 through 25 find nothing at all.

So roughly half the eligible sheet cannot be funded on a normal day. **Before
this change**, the 13 that got funded were the 13 that had asked for the most
risk, ties broken alphabetically. **After**, they are the top 13 of the desk's
own candidate ranking. The count funded is identical; which names they are is
not, and that was the whole point.

**The cut line: taken at reduced size, not skipped. Ratified 2026-09-14.**
When the ranking runs out of money part-way through a name, that name is
funded with whatever is left rather than passed over. The reason, recorded
because a decision without one rots: **cutting the size does not damage the
trade.** Same instrument, same stop, same reward-to-risk geometry — fewer
shares. Nothing about the idea is degraded by owning less of it. And it needs
no invented number, because the existing `min_position_risk_pct` floor (0.5)
already decides when a remainder is too small to be worth taking; below the
floor the target is DROPPED, never zeroed.

**Explicitly rejected at the cut line:** skipping the partially-affordable
name and continuing down the ranking for a cheaper one that fits in full. That
funds a worse-ranked idea purely because it costs less, which directly
contradicts the "go with the best" ruling. The rejected branch is kept written
and tested behind the named switch `PARTIAL_FIT_POLICY`, so revisiting the
ruling would be a decision rather than a rewrite — a ratified default is not a
reason to delete the alternative.

**Also rejected, at the 2026-09-12 decision:** proportional scale-down (sizing
everyone smaller turns every strong idea into a weak one), conviction tiering,
a hard cap on names per session, and re-tightening the reward:risk floor that
had just been removed.

**What "best-ranked" actually resolves to, and whether it is sound.** It is
`src/verdicts.py::rank_verdicts`, reused unchanged — no new score was invented
and none could be, under the no-arbitrary-numbers rule. Its order is: the
composite of each reporting seat's direction magnitude and conviction (seats
weighted by a research-informed prior, 2026-09-03), then the trade's real
structure-derived reward:risk as a tiebreak, then the symbol name as a final
stabiliser. Two honest caveats, stated rather than papered over:

- The symbol-name stabiliser is alphabetical. It is only reached when two
  candidates are equal on BOTH real signals, so this is not the "ranking is
  mostly alphabetical" defect already recorded against the EXIT path — that
  was checked for specifically. Entry ranking does not have it.
- The seat weights (1.2 technical/earnings, 1.0 news, 0.8 smart_money/macro)
  are a research-informed prior, not a measurement of THIS desk's analysts.
  That is already flagged on the board as item 31's posture. It was true
  before this change and is unchanged by it — but it is now load-bearing for
  which trades get funded, not only for the order they are listed in, which
  is a real increase in what that prior decides.

**The ranking that is used is the ranking the model was shown.** It is taken
from the Portfolio Manager's own prompt-rendering pass and threaded through to
the allocator, never recomputed downstream. Recomputing would risk rationing
against numbers the model never saw. Same pattern, and the same reason, as the
rotation pre-check.

**A candidate that loses the budget is no longer silent.** This was the one
constructor drop path with no durable per-symbol record. Its log line read
"Constructor: X produces no order — risk budget granted 0% ...", and the
drop-reason capture's pattern requires the words rejected/refused/skipped
after the symbol, so it did not match — every budget-rationed name reached the
database as the generic `constructor_dropped` with the detail "no matching
constructor log line captured". Verified by running the capture's own regex
against the real message before changing anything. It now goes through the
same structured refusal channel every other named constructor refusal uses,
under the code `risk_budget_exhausted`, with the requested percentage, the
binding ceiling and the plain statement that nothing is wrong with the idea —
it passed every gate and lost only the queue. Once the budget binds on a
normal day, that was about to become the largest unexplained bucket on the
sheet.

**Not zeroed, dropped.** A 0% risk target is read downstream as "sell it". A
budget refusal leaves no plan for the symbol at all, so the delta loop skips
it and a held position is left exactly where it is. Refusing to open is not a
decision to close. Pinned by a test.

**What was deliberately NOT done.** No new constant was introduced — the
change is an ordering, and it reads its order off machinery that already
exists. The backtest engine still rations largest-first, which with its
uniform requests means alphabetically; it has no candidate ranking to spend
down, so it was filed as its own open board item rather than papered over
with an invented score.

### 2026-09-13 — the desk could refuse every idea, every day, tell the truth each time, and never raise its voice (item 59)

**In plain words:** every kind of empty day already had its own honest
wording and its own alarm. What nothing watched was the PATTERN. If a fault
had jammed one gate shut, the desk would have reported "no trades today"
every morning, truthfully, forever, and nobody would have been told. That
matters more here than it sounds: in the window the census measured, 6
sessions out of 11 placed no trades at all, so a run of empty days is the
normal state of this desk — which is exactly what would have made a broken
run invisible. There is now an alarm for it, and it counts no days.

**Why no day count.** The obvious alarm — "tell me after N identical empty
days" — was refused, because there is no honest place to read N off. It
would have been invented, and an invented number is the thing this desk
does not ship. The reformulation that replaced it: **a jammed gate and a
quiet market differ in SHAPE, not in duration.** A quiet market kills
different candidates for different reasons — this one has no usable
structure, that one's reward:risk is thin, another is too young to measure.
A jammed gate kills every candidate with the SAME reason, and keeps doing it
while the candidates underneath it change.

So the trigger is stated with no threshold in it at all:

> every candidate, in every consecutive no-entry session back to the last
> session that ended any other way, was refused by ONE reason — the same
> one — while the set of candidates was NOT the same set each time.

The run of sessions is bounded by the data, not by a constant: it ends at
the last session that entered something, let a candidate through, refused
its candidates for more than one reason, or refused them for a different
one. "The candidate set was not the same set each time" is what forces more
than one session into it — you cannot observe that a reason did not vary
from a single observation, nor that the input varied from identical inputs.
Nothing is tuned and nothing was fitted to the desk's own trade history.

**A worked example, on real rows.** Two real sessions from 2026-09-02, the
last day the desk ran before the timers were paused, replayed through the
new check straight out of the production evidence table:

    intra_check-f90ec0ba   candidates: NVDA
    intra_check-ab906349   candidates: CEG, DE, VST, ZS

Every one of those five names ended on the identical terminal record —
`portfolio_manager / omitted / candidate_not_selected_for_target`. One
reason, five names, two sessions, and the candidate set changed completely
between them. Run against a database holding only those two sessions, the
check fires and says so in the owner's words. It does NOT fire against the
real database, because the session that actually sits between those two
placed an entry (ORCL) and the session after them let the cash-sweep
vehicle fill — either one ends the run. That is the alarm working, not the
alarm being lucky: both of those are cases where "it refused every idea" is
simply false.

**What made this buildable, and what it exposed.** The durable per-candidate
evidence rows written since 2026-09-03 (and extended 2026-09-12) do carry
what the plan assumed: a per-symbol, machine-readable row for every dropped
candidate, drained exactly once per session, already read by the funnel
census and by the evening blocked-proposals digest. Two things about them
are worth writing down before anyone trusts them further:

* **Only two refusals are recorded as named CODES** — a stop wider than the
  instrument's reach, and too little history to measure. Every other
  constructor drop reaches the record as `constructor_dropped` with a detail
  string recovered by a **regular expression over the constructor's own log
  lines**, and with a literal fallback of "no matching constructor log line
  captured" when the pattern misses. That is a real per-symbol row, so the
  candidate is never silently absent — but the reason inside it is prose,
  not a code, and a refactor that rewords a log line changes it. This alarm
  works around that by normalising the prose (the ticker and every numeric
  literal are replaced before two reasons are compared), which can only ever
  merge two texts describing the same rule, never split one rule in two — so
  its failure mode is a missed alarm, never a false one. It is a workaround
  for a gap, not a fix for it.
* **None of it has ever run in production.** The timers were paused on
  2026-09-03; the production evidence table contains 38 `pipeline_event`
  rows, all from 2026-09-02, and not one `constructor_dropped` or
  `constructor_refused` row among them. The refusal-recording path has been
  exercised only by tests. Nobody should cite it as proven in the field.

**How it behaves while the desk is paused.** It is silent, and needs no flag
to be. The check requires the newest session in the run to fall on the most
recent completed trading day — the same calendar the stop-coverage watchdog
already uses. A paused desk runs no sessions, so its newest session is
never current, so nothing is sent: a deliberately paused desk is not a
defect. It re-arms itself the moment sessions resume, because that is the
same moment the newest session becomes current again. Verified against a
copy of the live database: it reports the desk as not running and sends
nothing.

**Cadence.** At most one alert per trading day while the condition holds —
item 41's existing ruling, the same one the stop-coverage watchdog uses. No
new cadence was invented. It rides the daily alert-heartbeat unit, the one
thing proven to run whether or not the trading timers are on, and it can
never change that unit's own verdict or exit code.

### 2026-09-13 — item 15 (price provenance) closed: live quotes and price bars now carry the same honest freshness the position-mark slice shipped

**In plain words:** the piece of item 15 left open on 2026-09-03 — telling a
stale live price or chart price apart from a genuinely current one — is now
built. A live quote's price is tagged "stale" when nothing has traded for
that symbol since the market opened today (exactly the case that used to be
invisible: the feed goes quiet on an illiquid name and the desk would have
shown yesterday's last print as if it were live). Every chart bar is tagged
"historical" — it always was one, so this is a completeness fix, not a
behavior change. Nothing was invented to do this: the "is it stale" cutoff
comes from the exchange's own regular-session open time, read from Alpaca's
trading calendar (which already accounts for early-close days), not a
guessed number of minutes.

**Which slice was already shipped (2026-09-03), unchanged here:** held
positions' `current_price` carries `position_mark`, honestly `"unknown"`
freshness because Alpaca's position endpoint supplies no mark timestamp at
all. That code was not touched.

**What was open, and the actual architecture decision made.** The rescue
branch (`rescue/price-provenance`, uncommitted 2026-08-21 dev-account work)
had its own competing answer for quotes and bars: a second, dedicated Alpaca
market-data client (`_get_market_data_client`, `read_current_quote`) and a
hardcoded `_CURRENT_QUOTE_MAX_AGE = timedelta(minutes=15)` — a quote older
than 15 minutes was called "stale". That number was never sourced from
anything: not an exchange boundary, not IEX's own published behavior, not
this desk's own measured history — just asserted. It is rejected outright,
per the no-arbitrary-numbers rule, and was NOT merged.

Meanwhile `main` had independently built its own, already-live quote/bar
paths in the 11 days since the rescue branch's base commit:
`read_price_bars` (multi-timeframe, 5m/15m/1h via
`AlpacaBroker.get_intraday_chart_bars`, daily via `get_bars`, both with
caching) and `read_live_quotes`/`get_intraday_snapshots` (batched, with
per-symbol failure isolation). This is the richer, production-proven
implementation, so it wins — the fix was written directly against it rather
than resurrecting the rescue branch's redundant client.

**Where the freshness cutoff actually comes from.** Alpaca's `Trade` model
carries its own `timestamp` field for every last-trade print (confirmed
against the installed SDK: `alpaca.data.models.trades.Trade.model_fields`
includes `timestamp`) — a real provider-supplied market timestamp, not
something derived from our own data. A new `AlpacaBroker.get_session_open()`
reads today's regular-session open time from Alpaca's own trading calendar
(the same calendar `is_trading_day`/`get_session_close` already use,
including early-close days). `broker_reads._quote_freshness` compares the
two: a last-trade timestamp from before today's session open is `"stale"`
(nothing has traded since the prior session, or today isn't a trading day,
or the calendar lookup failed) — otherwise `"current"`. No elapsed-minutes
number appears anywhere in this logic.

**One incorrect docstring found and fixed along the way.**
`LiveQuotesResponse.as_of`'s comment claimed "Alpaca's snapshot SDK object
doesn't expose one [a per-trade timestamp] cleanly here" — false; the SDK's
`Trade.timestamp` was there the whole time, just never read.
`get_intraday_snapshots` now extracts and carries it as `last_trade_at`.

**What is still genuinely a separate, non-blocking gap.** Same posture as
the position-mark slice: the two frontend components
(`PositionsPanel.tsx`, `PriceChartPanel.tsx`) still don't render any of this
provenance — the API now serves `quote`/`close_price` correctly typed, but
nothing on the dashboard shows a "stale" badge yet. This is a display gap,
not a "cannot tell stale from live" gap: the honest answer now exists at the
API layer for any consumer (present or future) to read; Mission Control
simply hasn't been wired to show it, exactly as position_mark's frontend
wiring was deferred on 2026-09-03 without blocking that slice's close.

**`rescue/price-provenance` is now dead — evidence, not assumption.** Its
one useful slice (position_mark) was already merged 2026-09-03. Its
remaining unmerged content (`.rej` hunks in `src/api/broker_reads.py.rej`,
`src/api/routes_live.py.rej`) is the redundant client + arbitrary threshold
described above, which this entry replaces with a sourced implementation
against main's own code. Nothing on the branch is still needed. Recommend
deletion (not done here — branch deletion is the owner's call per standing
instruction).

**Tests:** `tests/test_broker.py` (+5: `get_session_open` mirrors
`get_session_close`'s early-close/none/error/caching coverage),
`tests/test_broker_market_data.py` (+1, plus 2 existing full-equality
assertions updated for the new `last_trade_at` field),
`tests/test_broker_reads.py` (+9: `_quote_freshness` unit coverage, bar
`close_price` provenance for both daily and intraday timeframes, one
end-to-end stale-quote test, plus 2 existing tests updated for the new
`quote` field). Full targeted run: 209 passed
(`test_broker_reads.py test_broker.py test_broker_market_data.py
test_api_contract.py`) plus 160 passed
(`test_intraday_scan.py test_intraday_scan_crash_visibility.py
test_invariants.py test_pipeline.py`, the other real consumers of
`get_intraday_snapshots`) — 369 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped across every
file that touches the changed code paths.

### 2026-09-13 — the Risk Manager's and Portfolio Manager's prompt sheets now render their limits from settings, not hand-typed prose

The reviewer's standing sheet stated its limits as hand-typed prose. It said
the long single-name ceiling was **33%** against a real `max_position_pct` of
**65** — and that was **wrong at birth, not drift**: commit `e1c639a2`
(PR #297, titled "single-name cap 100 -> 33") set the setting to 65 and typed
33 into the sheet in the same diff. The same commit ALSO wrote
`max_position_pct=65` correctly into the sheet's hard-rule inventory, so the
sheet contradicted itself from minute one. **No verdict or log row has been
found showing the stale 33 changed an outcome, and none is claimed** — what
was fixed is an internal contradiction and the mechanism that allowed it.

The line that commit replaced was relational ("half the long single-name
ceiling") and therefore drift-immune; it was swapped for a literal. That
sentence is now relational again. A second, genuinely stale one said the
constructor caps a stop-out at 0.5% of equity against a ratified
`max_position_risk_pct` of 5 — and it named the wrong binding mechanism as
well, since the §9.4 agreement ceiling and the budget allocator narrow the
real per-trade budget before the 5% envelope is reached. Rewritten to name
what binds first.

The sheet now carries `{{risk.<setting>}}` placeholders rendered by
`src/agents/prompt_limits.py` from the same config object the engine is built
from, **at agent construction** (not on first LLM call, which is the risk
stage — after the whole day's analysis is paid for). Two build checks: a
number beside a setting's name, and a number stated as the value of a
ceiling/cap/budget/limit/floor phrase. Only the second catches the 2026-09-11
shape; that gap is pinned by its own test.

**FOUND WHILE FIXING — pre-existing, latent, NOT swept.** `src/pipeline.py`
builds the risk engine's `RiskConfig` from a hand-enumerated argument list.
**22 declared risk settings were absent from it** and silently fell back to
pydantic class defaults, ignoring settings.yaml. Every one of those defaults
currently equals its settings value, so nothing is live-wrong — but
`allow_margin` was the same omission and did bite (it defaulted False while
settings said True, blocking a user's BUYs). The seven settings the two sheets
render are now threaded; **the remaining 15 are open work**, pinned by a test
that fails if the count grows or if any omitted setting ever diverges from its
default. Threading them changes enforcement and needs its own review.

**PM's sheet, same treatment, same PR series.** `portfolio_manager.md` now
renders ten settings and `tests/test_prompts_anchors.py`'s two value anchors
are retargeted to the placeholders. Correcting an earlier claim in this
entry: PM's sheet did not stay correct on 2026-09-11 because the human
process was better — it stayed correct because that anchor test pinned the
literal and the reviewer's sheet had no such anchor. The check held; it just
cost a third hand-maintained copy of the number.

**PM's parity is against TWO objects, not one.** `src/risk/rules.py` contains
no reference at all to `max_cluster_risk_share_pct`, `short_gap_risk_multiple`,
`min_position_risk_pct` or `max_portfolio_risk_pct` — those four are enforced
by `PortfolioConstructor` from a separately built `ConstructorConfig`. The
parity tests now build BOTH objects through the pipeline's own extracted
builders (`build_risk_config`, `build_constructor_config`) and check that
MOVING a setting moves what the objects carry, rather than scanning
`src/pipeline.py` for a keyword name — a scan a hard-coded
`max_gross_bearish_pct=20.0` would have satisfied.

**Still open, pre-existing:** `build_constructor_config`'s `_risk_setting(name,
default)` pattern types a literal fallback for roughly twenty settings, so each
of those keeps a home in `src/pipeline.py` on top of settings.yaml and the
dataclass field default. Not touched here — sweeping it changes sizing
fallbacks nobody has reviewed. The equivalent literals on the risk engine's
side were removed in this PR (`_threaded_risk_settings` omits a non-numeric
read instead of substituting a number), and `min_position_risk_pct` now passes
a legal **0** through both paths rather than being swallowed into a default.

**Also open:** `config/settings.yaml`'s own `max_single_short_pct` comment
still says "At 33 this cap is now roughly a THIRD of the long ceiling" —
stale from the same commit, in the settings file itself.

### 2026-09-13 — the rehearsal report attributed trades to the portfolio manager even when it never ran (item 61)

**In plain words:** after a test rehearsal, a summary report would print how
many trades "the portfolio manager proposed" — but the count included trades
from other sources that shared the run_id. On one run where the Portfolio
Manager had failed (returned no valid decision), the report printed "1" when
the only trade in the database came from emergency liquidation, not the PM.
Costs nothing in real trading (a rehearsal is offline, no capital at risk),
but it misleads whoever reads the report to judge whether a rehearsal ran as
intended.

**The mechanism.** `_collect_counts()` counted trades by querying the `trades`
table (`SELECT COUNT(*) ... WHERE action IN ('BUY', 'SELL')`), which is wrong
for two reasons: (1) BUY/SELL trades come from other session stages that share
the run_id — emergency liquidation at src/pipeline.py:8008 and position reviewer
exits at :9281 — and get falsely attributed to the PM; (2) when the PM stage
enters but fails (a common case), its agent_logs entry is still written with the
failure string as output_summary, so no proxy check on agent_logs can
distinguish failure from success.

**The fix:** count from `specialist_evidence` rows where `agent_name='portfolio_manager'`
and `kind='proposed_order'`. These rows are written only AFTER the PM decision
passes validation (src/pipeline_stages.py:4292-4300), so they correctly capture
only valid PM proposals and exclude both the failure case and trades from other
sources. This is shorter, needs no proxy, and is the ground truth.

### 2026-09-13 — the insider holdings data the board said we did not have was already being downloaded, parsed and stored — and the filter using it was throwing away the one band the research calls a buy signal (item 52)

**In plain words:** the board carried an open owner decision asking whether to
go and buy, or somehow approximate, data on how much stock an insider already
owns — because judging a sale by its dollar size is weaker than judging it by
what share of the person's own position it represents. The premise was wrong.
Every SEC Form 4 the desk downloads already states the filer's holding
immediately after the trade, the desk already parses that number, and it
already stores it on every observation. This was never an acquisition
problem. It was a wiring problem, and the wiring was half done.

**How the premise was checked rather than assumed.** Pulled the SEC EDGAR
daily index for 2026-09-11 (895 Form 4 filings), downloaded the first 120
submissions and parsed them with the desk's own XPath. Of 77 open-market
purchase/sale rows across those filings, 77 carried
`postTransactionAmounts/sharesOwnedFollowingTransaction` — 100%, no gaps. The
ratio needs no new source, no subscription and no approximation.

**What was already half-built.** The routine/opportunistic classifier has had
a proportional sell test since it was written: it reconstructs the
pre-transaction holding and asks what fraction was sold. So the item's
substance was partly live already. What was missing: purchases had no such
measure at all, and nothing outside that one classifier branch ever saw the
ratio — the number was computed, used for a single yes/no, and thrown away
before the analyst seat or the operator could weigh it.

**The number that filter used was invented.** The materiality boundary was
0.05. Traced through the code comments and the research notes, that 5%
matches no published band anywhere; the research note it cites carried the
claim with no citation attached at all. Chasing the claim to its actual
source: Scott & Xu, *Some Insider Sales Are Positive Signals*, Financial
Analysts Journal 60(3), 2004 — 512,133 transactions, 80,742 company-quarters,
1987-2002, and genuinely a measurement rather than an assertion. They cut
"shares traded as a percentage of shares owned" at **10% and 50%**, not 5%.
Their size- and book-to-price-adjusted quarterly excess returns: sales over
100,000 shares are significantly negative only in the over-50% band (-0.81%);
in the two lower bands they are -0.06% and +0.08%, both insignificant. Sales
under 100,000 shares in the under-10% band are significantly *positive*
(+0.68%) — a proportionally small sale is a mildly good sign, not a neutral
one. Purchases scale the same way: +0.38% / +1.06% / +1.42% across the three
bands, with initial purchases (no prior holding, so no ratio exists) earning
an insignificant +0.10%.

**What the source does NOT license, and was therefore not built.** Their
ratio is a net, per-stock-quarter figure, computed over a six-month formation
window against holdings aggregated across every insider in that stock who
reported a holding. One Form 4 row is not that object. So their band returns
do not carry over to a per-transaction admission gate, and no second cutoff
was invented to fill the gap. The ratio is reported on every row, for buys
and sells alike, and banded with the paper's own boundaries; the dollar
materiality filter that admits a symbol is untouched. A test pins this: two
purchases identical in dollars but at opposite ends of the holdings range
both survive admission unchanged.

**The first attempt at the fix was also wrong, and this is the part worth
remembering.** The obvious repair was to move the cutoff from the invented
0.05 to 0.10, the paper's lowest band edge. That was written, reviewed
adversarially, and rejected before it merged. Three things were wrong with
it, and all three are visible in the paper itself.

*The desk's question was not the paper's question.* The setting asks "below
what fraction of a holding is a sale not a directional view". The only place
the paper's prose marks a significance boundary is at half, not a tenth:
"The group of stocks with net total sales exceeding 100,000 shares had an
average excess return of −0.55 percent, but of that group, those stocks for
which shares sold accounted for more than half of shares owned had average
excess return of −1.17 percent. Excess returns on stocks with the same level
of shares sold but a lower percentage of holdings were negative but
statistically insignificant." A band edge on a results table is a place the
authors chose to cut a column. It is not a measured threshold, and 10% was
being read as one purely because it was the smallest number printed.

*The label being applied stated the opposite of the evidence.* "Small sales
that represented small percentages of shares owned not only did not predict
poor performance but were associated with significantly positive abnormal
returns." ROUTINE, in this classifier, means Cohen/Malloy/Pomorski's "carries
no predictive power", and carries weight 0.0 — which is both the ranking sort
key and the dollar multiplier deciding what the analyst seat ever sees. So a
row the source measures at +0.68% with 1% significance was being labelled
"no information" and then deleted from the ranking. The detail string the
rejected version generated even said the paper finds these mildly positive,
one line above the code that discarded the row for it.

*The PR had already made the correct argument, for purchases only.* It
refused to gate buys on the same bands, on the ground that the paper's ratio
is a net per-stock-quarter figure over a six-month window against holdings
aggregated across insiders, which is not the same object as one Form 4 row.
That refusal is owed to sells too. Applying it to one direction and not the
other was inconsistency, not judgement.

**What was actually done.** The cutoff was removed, not moved, and no
replacement was invented. `insider_min_material_sell_fraction` is deleted
from the config model, from settings.yaml, from the classifier thresholds and
from the provider and pipeline wiring; a test now fails if it reappears on
either the thresholds dataclass or the config model. A sale that survives the
two Cohen/Malloy/Pomorski routine tests is `discretionary_sale`, and carries
its holdings ratio, its band, and — new — the sign the paper measured for
that band, so the seat is handed the direction of the evidence and not just a
number. Under 10%: mildly bullish, +0.68%. 10–50%: +0.44%. Over 50%: the only
band that predicts negative returns, and only above 100,000 shares, −0.81%.

**What this costs, stated plainly.** A proportionally tiny sale now ranks at
weight 1.0 alongside an insider liquidating most of a position. That is not
right either — the paper says their signs differ. It is less wrong than
weight 0.0, which asserts the row is uninformative when the source says it is
informative and positive, and it does not require inventing a number. The
real gap is structural: `signal_weight` is a single "how much attention"
scalar with no way to express "attention, and the sign is the other way".
That is now WORK.md item 62, and it is deliberately left open rather than
closed by choosing a multiplier.

**The 10b5-1 branch went with it.** A small planned sale used to be demoted
to routine. That branch existed only to reinforce the immateriality cutoff —
the research note is explicit that the flag is not a clean noise filter, and
nothing in it licenses demoting a sale on the flag alone. With no cutoff, the
flag demotes nothing and is reported in the detail text instead.

**Also corrected.** The research note's "size relative to holdings" bullet had
been carrying the conclusion with no source behind it since it was written.
It now names Scott & Xu, the sample, the bands, the numbers and the two
sentences above, so the next reader does not have to re-derive where the
claim came from — or repeat the mistake of reading a column edge as a
finding.

**What would catch it next time.** The tell was available without reading the
paper: the code's own generated text contradicted the code's own decision in
adjacent lines. When a detail string explains why a row matters and the
branch it sits in throws that row away, one of the two is wrong. The second
tell was a citation used at the wrong altitude — the paper was quoted
accurately, every figure checked out, and the conclusion still did not
follow, because nobody asked whether the paper had measured the boundary the
setting needed or merely printed a number near it.

**Decision recorded.** No owner call is needed: nothing had to be acquired and
nothing paid for. Item 52 is NOT deleted — it was independently reframed on
main the same day into a different, genuinely open question (should an insider
trade be admitted or refused on ANY measure of its size), which this work does
not answer and deliberately did not build. What this work does settle is that
item's original premise: the holdings data exists, and the relative measure is
computed and reported. That correction is written into item 52, and the one
piece that cannot be settled by any source found is filed separately as item
63.

### 2026-09-13 — the permanently-red cost-ceiling test: what it was actually failing on, and why the September fix could not have worked (item 28)

**In plain words:** one automated check had been failing every single run for
over a week, and everyone had learned to read "1 failed" as normal. It was
declared fixed on 2026-09-04 and it was not. The reason it kept failing had
nothing to do with money or with the cost limit it was supposed to be
guarding — it was failing because it demanded that a rehearsal of an old
trading morning use exactly as many AI calls as that morning did, and the
desk now watches more stocks than it did then, so it needs more.

**What the check exists for.** On the morning of 2026-08-28 the desk's
spending circuit refused the Portfolio Manager's call outright, so no trade
was proposed at all. The refusal was based on a *projection* of what the call
might cost: it guessed the session would reach $1.9118 against a $1.80
ceiling. The four analyst calls that had actually run that morning had settled
at $0.0460784 between them. The circuit stopped the desk on an estimate forty
times the real spend. The check's job is to be able to reproduce that class of
failure offline, on demand, for free.

**Why the 2026-09-04 fix could not have worked.** That fix deleted a second
test function that set two config keys the cost-circuit rewrite had removed,
and rewrote the surviving test's comments. Its recorded verification was that
the file "compiles and can be collected" — it was never run. Two separate
things were wrong underneath and neither was touched:

1. *The surviving assertions guarded nothing.* All three trigger codes it
   checked for had been deleted from the codebase along with the projection
   layer. Asserting that three non-existent codes do not appear is true of any
   run of any code.
2. *The failure was somewhere else entirely.* The test insisted the technical
   analyst never run out of recorded answers to replay. The rehearsal harness
   snapshots production as it stands **today** and replays answers recorded on
   2026-08-28; today's watchlist needs one more chunked call than that
   morning's recording contains. The harness's own documentation says a
   rehearsal is "a fresh session against a snapshot of production's state, not
   a re-enactment of a past one" — so the test was asserting against the
   harness's stated design, and would have stayed red however the cost circuit
   behaved.

**This was already written down, and the fix ignored it.** `docs/WORK.md` has
carried the correct symptom since 2026-09-02, in the handoff text above the
backlog: "today's pipeline makes more `tech_analyst` chunk calls than
`run-be9f8f06` recorded ('all 4 recorded response(s) were already replayed')".
Two days later the item was closed against a different theory without anyone
running the test to see which of the two it actually was.

**What was ruled out.** Not a production defect: the cost circuit is behaving
as item 14 intended. Not a stale-config problem either — that was the
2026-09-04 diagnosis and it was already resolved by then. Not deletable: the
2026-08-28 failure *class* — the ceiling refusing the Portfolio Manager before
it can spend — is still reachable, just through a different mechanism, so
there was nothing to prove structurally impossible.

**What the check does now.** It runs the same rehearsal twice against
byte-identical inputs. The first run uses production's own configured ceiling
and must reach the Portfolio Manager; it then reads out of that run's own
cost ledger what had really settled by that point. The second run repeats the
session with the ceiling set to that measured figure and nothing else changed,
and requires that the settled-cost circuit fires and that the Portfolio
Manager never reaches the provider at all. No number is invented: the ceiling
is measured from the run it is applied to. The two runs read the same bytes
because the second works from a copy of the prepared sandbox rather than a
fresh snapshot of a production database that keeps moving.

The tech-analyst assertion is gone on purpose, and the reason is written into
the test: running out of recorded chunks is expected drift between a snapshot
taken now and a recording made in August, and it is reported as a finding
rather than treated as a defect. What still guards the chunk un-merge fix —
before which replay ran dry on the second chunk and the session died nowhere
near the Portfolio Manager — is the first run having to reach the Portfolio
Manager at all.

**Proof it still bites.** With the settled-session-spend branch of
`_enforce_settled_limits_locked` disabled, the check fails on exactly the
assertion that matters (the ceiling never fires and the Portfolio Manager
reaches the provider). Restored, it passes.

**The lesson worth keeping.** A test recorded as fixed without being run is
not fixed, and a permanently-red test trains everyone to ignore the failure
count — which is the same as having no test at all, plus a hiding place for
the next one to break. "Compiles and can be collected" is not verification.

### 2026-09-13 — item 17 closed: the desk-wide silence alarm's own systemd timer was finally installed on the production box, ten days after it started warning about itself

**In plain words:** item 17 was "the desk can switch itself off silently."
Three code fixes shipped for it back on 2026-09-03. This entry closes out the
one part that was still genuinely open: whether those fixes were actually
running on the live box, not just merged into the repository.

**What was found.** A 2026-09-12 check (recorded under WORK.md item 53 /
BOARD_NOTES 53) reported that the desk-wide silence watchdog's own systemd
timer (item 17c, `quant-agent-silence-heartbeat.timer`) had no state file and
was absent from the box's timer list — so the alarm built specifically to
catch "the desk went quiet and nobody noticed" had, itself, never run in
production. Re-checked today, read-only, directly on `/home/qamc/quant-agent`
(a separate checkout from this one, `qamc` user, detached HEAD at the same
commit as `origin/main`):

- The box's own `quant-agent-unit-drift.service` — a separate, already-running
  watchdog that diffs installed systemd units against the repository — had
  been alerting on exactly this gap every day from at least 2026-09-07 through
  2026-09-13 12:50 UTC ("In the repository but NOT installed:
  quant-agent-silence-heartbeat.service/.timer"). Ten days of daily alerts.
- Sometime between that 12:50 UTC alert and 18:31 UTC the same day, the
  missing units were installed on the box (`~/.config/systemd/user/`, files
  dated 17:50 UTC) and the timer was enabled (symlink into
  `timers.target.wants/`, dated 18:31 UTC) — the exact `cp scripts/systemd/*
  ~/.config/systemd/user/ && systemctl --user daemon-reload` step the
  unit-drift alert itself names as the fix. This did not go through a commit;
  the box's git log is unchanged. It was a manual operator action, taken in
  response to the drift alarm, outside this PR.
- It has run as designed since: `systemctl --user status
  quant-agent-silence-heartbeat.timer` shows it enabled and active, the
  `.service` has completed successfully on its 30-minute cadence since
  18:31:16, and `data/alerting/silence_heartbeat.json` is being updated on
  every run. Because the trading timers are deliberately paused, the checks
  since installation correctly take the "desk paused on purpose" branch
  (`check_paused_desk`) rather than the silence-alert branch — the same
  paused-desk behavior this file's other 2026-09-13 entry on item 11
  describes, and exactly what the once-per-weekday paused-desk reminder is
  for.

**What this closes, and what it does not.** Items 17a and 17c are fully
closed: the code shipped 2026-09-03, and the production deployment gap
flagged 2026-09-12 is now verified fixed and running. Item 17b's code (the
failed-alert-persists-and-retries fix) was also shipped 2026-09-03 and is
unaffected by this finding. The one thing item 17 still names as open — a
genuine second alert channel beyond Telegram — was never a code defect; it is
an unresolved owner decision, unchanged by today's check, and stays recorded
under `docs/BOARD_NOTES.md` ("item 17").

**What would catch a repeat of the ten-day gap.** Nothing new was built for
this — `scripts/check_unit_drift.py` already did its job, alerting every day
the gap existed. The ten days between "flagged" and "fixed" was a human
response-time gap, not a missing alarm, and no number is invented here to
police how fast an alert must be acted on.

### 2026-09-13 — a prompt limit that was wrong the moment it was written, and the drift-immune phrasing it replaced

**In plain words:** the desk's risk reviewer is briefed by a written
instruction sheet. One sentence on it said no single holding may exceed 33% of
the book. The real limit is 65%. This was NOT a number that went stale over
time — it was wrong on the day it was typed.

**What actually happened.** Commit `e1c639a2` (2026-09-11, PR #297, titled
"single-name cap 100 -> 33") changed `risk.max_position_pct` and edited the
reviewer's sheet in the same diff, about a hundred lines apart. The change
landed at **65**, not the 33 in its own title — the owner reviewed the
derivation and set his own risk-appetite number partway through. One hunk got
the correction and the other did not. So the sheet said 33 from its first
minute.

**The harm is smaller than it first looks, and saying so matters.** The SAME
commit also wrote `max_position_pct=65` correctly into the sheet's hard-rule
inventory — the more authoritative of the two places. The sheet therefore
CONTRADICTED ITSELF; it did not uniformly teach a wrong ceiling. No log row,
no verdict and no modification has been found showing the stale 33 ever
changed an outcome, and none is claimed. The honest description of what was
fixed is **"removed an internal contradiction and the mechanism that allowed
it"**, not "stopped the desk trading against a wrong limit". Overstating a
finding is the same failure as understating one.

**The part worth learning from.** The line that commit REPLACED read
"`max_single_short_pct` (10%, **half the long single-name ceiling**". That is
a RELATION. It names one number and expresses the other as a relationship, so
it carries no second copy and cannot go wrong when either limit moves. The
commit swapped a drift-immune phrasing for a hand-typed literal — and the
literal was wrong immediately. The lesson is not "be more careful when
copying numbers"; it is that a sentence about how two limits RELATE should
stay relational, and only a limit the reviewer actually AUDITS against needs
its value stated at all.

**A second, older one on the same sheet.** It also said the constructor caps
a stop-out at 0.5% of equity. The ratified per-trade envelope is 5%
(`max_position_risk_pct`, 2026-08-27); 0.5 is `min_position_risk_pct`, the
starter-size floor — a different setting. That sentence had genuinely gone
stale, and it was doubly misleading: at 5% the outer envelope mostly does not
bind, because the §9.4 agreement ceiling and the portfolio budget allocator
narrow the real per-trade budget first. A reviewer reconciling a 3% cap-note
against a sheet naming 5% as THE cap is pointed at the wrong mechanism.

**What was ruled out.** Not a model failure: the reviewer applied the numbers
it was given. Not a settings error: `max_position_pct: 65` was right
everywhere the engine reads. Not the pipeline: the value reached the
deterministic gate intact. Only the briefing was wrong, and the briefing was
the one input nothing compared against anything.

**A latent defect found while fixing it, worth more than the original.**
`src/pipeline.py` builds the risk engine's config from a hand-enumerated
argument list. Any declared setting left out of that list silently falls back
to the pydantic class default and `settings.yaml` is ignored for it. **22 of
the declared risk settings were in that state.** Today every one of those
defaults happens to equal its settings value, so nothing was live-wrong — but
this has bitten before: `allow_margin` was the same omission, defaulting to
False while settings.yaml said True, and it blocked a user's BUYs. The seven
settings the two sheets now render are threaded through; the other 15 are
recorded in `docs/WORK.md` rather than swept in a change nobody asked for.

**Why the Portfolio Manager's sheet did NOT go wrong in the same commit — the
most useful part of this.** That commit edited both sheets. PM's copy of the
same ceiling stayed right, and NOT because anyone was more careful with it:
`tests/test_prompts_anchors.py` pinned the literal string "capped at 65%
single-name" in PM's sheet and had no equivalent value anchor on the
reviewer's sheet at all. A mechanical check held; an unchecked copy did not.
That is this desk's own standing lesson restated — everything mechanically
enforced holds, everything relying on remembering a rule slips.

The anchor held by keeping a THIRD hand-maintained copy of the number
(settings.yaml, the prompt, and the test's own string), so every change to
the cap had to touch all three or CI went red on the last one. Both sheets
now render the value instead, and the anchor is retargeted to pin the
placeholder rather than the digits.

**What catches it next time, and what does not.** The sheet no longer contains
limit values, only placeholders rendered from the same config object the
engine is built from, checked at agent construction rather than mid-session. A
test fails the build on two shapes: a number typed beside a setting's name,
and a number stated as the value of a "ceiling / cap / budget / limit / floor"
phrase. The second is the one that catches the 2026-09-11 shape; the first,
tested honestly, does not — that gap is pinned by its own test so nobody
describes the adjacency check as sufficient. Neither catches a limit restated
with no setting name and no limit noun, nor a placeholder citing the wrong
setting for its sentence. This makes the observed defect fail the build. It
does not make the class of defect impossible.

### 2026-09-13 — a fifth of what the trade-picking seat reads said nothing at all (item 18d / PM gate item 7)

**In plain words:** the seat that actually picks the trades reads a long
briefing assembled from every other seat's work. Nobody had ever counted what
is in the CURRENT briefing — the only count anyone had was from 2026-09-02,
before the earnings fix. Counting it found that about a fifth of everything
that seat reads is filler: entries for companies where the analyst read the
filing, reached no view, and still got four lines of space to say so, and
entries for stocks with no tradeable setup that spent four fields printing the
word "None". Those are now one line each. The briefing is 15% shorter and
nothing was thrown away — every company is still named, and the reason it has
no view is still stated next to its name.

**The measurement, so nobody has to redo it.** The frozen `run_64290730`
fixture rendered through the live `build_user_message`: **100,968 characters
across 25 sections.** Section shares before the change:

| Section | chars | % | conclusion or raw material |
|---|---|---|---|
| Earnings Analysis | 32,850 | 32.5% | conclusion (call/conviction/thesis/falsifier) — but see below |

| Canonical Evidence Registry | 6,869 | 6.8% | conclusion (machine-readable stances) |

| Smart Money Evidence | 92 | 0.1% | conclusion |
| Proposal Conversion | 68 | 0.1% | fact |

**Item 18's "70%" claim is CONFIRMED, not corrected.** The archived
2026-09-02 render (`PM_PROMPT_run64290730_rendered.txt`, 199,139 chars) breaks
down as 140,107 chars of Earnings Analysis = **70.4%**. The claim was right to
one decimal place. It is now 21.5%.

**What the count actually found, which is not what item 18 said was left.**
Item 18's surviving bullet said earnings was still the biggest section and
needed "cutting/summarising further". That framing was wrong. Earnings was
already in the bounded shape PR #252 gave it — the problem was not that the
conclusions were too long, it was that **38 of the 65 analysed filings had no
conclusion in them.** The seat returned `sentiment: neutral`, and
`EarningsAnalysis.to_verdict()` renders no invalidation for a non-directional
read, so each of those 38 spent four lines on a direction the PM cannot trade,
a thesis the analyst did not write, and the literal string "Invalidated if:
not disclosed by the analyst". 16,885 chars — **16.7% of the entire
briefing** — of an analyst saying nothing, formatted to look like analysis.
The same shape appeared in the technical section: 21 of 59 reads were
`neutral`, which by construction means no entry, no stop, no target and
`risk_reward is None`, so each printed "Entry: None | Stop: None | Target:
None" and "Invalid if: (not specified)". Another 5.2%.

**Why this is a shape change and not a truncation limit.** There is no length
threshold anywhere in the fix and no cap on how many entries survive. The
partition is read from the data: a filing rolls up if and only if its
collapsed stance is non-directional, and a technical read compacts if and only
if it is neutral AND has no reward/risk. On a day where every seat reaches a
call, nothing is shortened at all. No number was invented and none was fitted
to this desk's history.

**What was deliberately preserved, because losing it would have been the
regression.** Every rolled-up symbol is still named on its own line with its
form, filing date, conviction and cache/staleness marker, so "read, concluded
nothing" stays distinguishable from "never read" — a saving that made coverage
invisible would have been worse than the filler. A `mixed` stance is NOT
rolled up: mixed is a disagreement between sources, not an absence of one, and
a summary that hides a split is worse for the decision seat than the prose it
replaces. And the whole dissent path is untouched — a neutral earnings read
still lands in the Canonical Evidence Registry and still subtracts in the
Independent Source Agreement net score that ceilings position size, so
shortening the prompt cannot quietly have RAISED sizing. There are tests
asserting each of those three things against the real fixture.

**What was NOT done, and why.** Macro is the one seat still couriering full
reasoning: its 6-paragraph `reasoning_chain` goes in verbatim under "audit
these for logic errors". That is deliberate, it is only 2,287 chars, and
removing it is a PROMPT change — which the rehearsal rig provably cannot
validate (it replays recorded answers into a changed prompt and passes
regardless). It needs the paid `--replay-run` benchmark, which was not
authorised for this work. The two biggest remaining sections, Technical
Analysis and Independent Source Agreement, are both already bounded and both
scale with how many names got covered; there is no honest cap to put on
either, so the lever there is coverage breadth, not rendering.

**Standing warning, unchanged from item 18a/18b/18c:** this is a measured
reduction in what the model READS. Nobody has measured whether it decides any
better. Model-behaviour fixes on this desk have repeatedly measured as
no-change, and a shorter prompt is not evidence of a better one.

### 2026-09-13 — the board said the trade-sizing bands were still awaiting sign-off; they had been merged by the owner three days earlier (item 32 record correction)

**In plain words:** the desk's decision-maker is given bands for how much of
the account a trade may risk depending on how convinced it is. Those bands
had been narrowed in August to compensate for a separate bug, and the
proposal to widen them back was recorded on the board as "still awaiting the
owner's actual sign-off". It was not. The owner merged the change himself on
10 September, and the wider bands have been the live instruction ever since.
The board went on describing a settled thing as undecided.

**How the two came apart.** The original pull request was mechanically
auto-closed by GitHub when an unrelated branch it was stacked on was deleted
— nobody rejected it. Its content was restored on a fresh pull request, and
the "PENDING REVIEW, the owner never saw this" note was written at that
point, correctly. What went wrong is that when the replacement was merged,
the merge updated one part of the board and not the other: the same item
ended up carrying a line saying the question was DECIDED and, further down,
the original paragraph still saying it was pending. Both were sitting in the
same item, contradicting each other, for three days.

**Which was right.** The running configuration. Verified by reading the live
prompt (the bands are there, 2.0-4.0% and 1.0-2.5%) and the commit that put
them there (authored and merged by the owner, 2026-09-10). The board text was
the stale half, and it has been deleted rather than annotated.

**What would catch it next time.** Nothing mechanical exists for this, and it
is worth being honest that this is the second time a stale board line has
survived a merge that was supposed to remove it (the item 17(b) duplicate was
the first). The rule that keeps failing is "update the record in the same
commit as the change"; the pattern in both cases was a merge that edited the
summary line and left the detail paragraph. When resolving a board item that
appears in two places, search the item number, do not edit the paragraph you
happen to be looking at.

### 2026-09-13 — three of the five analyst seats had their "how strongly do you lean" number invented from the same field as their "how sure are you" number, so the ranking counted one opinion twice (item 31, CLOSED)

**In plain words:** when the desk ranks which stock ideas look best, each
specialist contributes two separate numbers — how strongly it leans, and how
confident it is — and the desk adds them together. Three of the five
specialists had no real "how strongly" number to give, because nothing they
produce measures it. So when those seats were wired into the ranking, someone
filled the gap by working the lean out from the confidence. That means the
desk was adding a number to itself: one opinion, counted twice, and the
multipliers used to do the doubling were picked, not measured or read from
any published source. A single "insiders are buying right now" label scored
the highest total the ranking can produce — the same as the one specialist
that was actually measured to produce real conclusions, at its strongest
rating and highest confidence, together.

**What each of the four newly-wired seats was doing, and the verdict on each.**
This is the independent review item 31 asked for.

  * **earnings — CONVENTION, kept unchanged.** Every directional call got one
    flat number and neutral got zero. This seat states a single
    bullish/bearish rung with no strength field anywhere, and its author said
    so and refused to invent a gradient. It is the only one of the four that
    did not invent a weight, and it is the shape the other three were brought
    to.
  * **news — ASSERTED, neutralised.** The lean was a table on the seat's own
    confidence (low/medium/high -> 0.33/0.67/1.0). Nothing sourced, and it is
    the same confidence the verdict separately reports.
  * **macro — ASSERTED, neutralised.** The lean was a table on the seat's own
    confidence (0.25/0.5/0.75) plus a flat bonus (0.25) when the analyst
    declared a regime change. Same double-count, plus a second invented
    constant on top. The regime-change claim is not lost: it still reaches
    the reader as the analyst's own stated falsifier, in the analyst's own
    words, rather than as a number nobody derived.
  * **smart_money — ASSERTED, neutralised.** Both halves — the lean AND the
    confidence — were tables on one categorical label. Both signals were the
    same label. The label still sets confidence, which is the one place it
    has something behind it: the ordering there restates a ranking that
    already existed in the seat for a different purpose, with the seat's own
    prompt explaining why.

**What was ruled out.** Finding a published source for any of the three
spacings — there is nothing to cite for "a high-confidence news item leans
three times as far as a low-confidence one", and fitting one to this desk's
own trade history is forbidden and impossible anyway (the book has almost no
resolved history). The choice was therefore between leaving invented weights
in place and removing them, and removing them is the standing rule: a number
must be read from the instrument or from a source, or it should not be there.
This change DELETES arbitrary numbers rather than replacing them with
better-argued ones. If a seat is ever measured to deserve a real gradient,
that is a weight to ratify with the measurement attached.

**The second half of item 31 — macro was answering one question with two
different answers in the same prompt.** The macro specialist gives a broad
market view and, separately, a per-sector view. The block of the prompt that
lists what each specialist thinks about each stock was already using the
sector view where one existed, falling back to the broad view otherwise. The
ranking was using the broad view for every stock. So the desk could tell its
decision-maker "macro is negative on energy" in one part of the prompt and
rank an energy name on a positive broad read in another part. Now both
resolve the same way, through the same shared reduction, so one macro read
gives one answer.

The objection recorded at the time — that there was "nothing sector-specific
to attach" — was half right. There is no sector-specific *confidence*, so the
analyst's own overall confidence is still used, unchanged, rather than
inventing one. But there IS sector-specific *reasoning*: the sector row's own
stated reason, already on the model, and it is now cited first on the verdict
and labelled as the thing that decided the direction, so a reader can see why
this stock's macro read differs from the market's.

**What would catch it next time.** The double-count is now a test in its own
right for each of the three seats: change only the field the deleted table
was keyed on, and the lean must not move. That is mechanical, so it holds;
the comment saying "flagged for review" did not, for ten days.

**The general lesson, which is the part worth keeping.** All three defects
came from the same move: a seat was wired into a scoring shape that wanted
two numbers, the seat only had one, and the gap was filled by deriving the
missing number from the one that existed. Every author flagged their own
mapping as unmeasured and none of them was wrong to ship it — but a flag in a
code comment is not a review, and three of them accumulated before anyone
compared them side by side. When a seat cannot fill a field, the honest fill
is not a function of another field.

**CORRECTED THE SAME DAY, BEFORE MERGE — the sentence above originally ended
"the honest fill is a constant, not a function of another field", and the fix
it describes filled the gap with 0.5.** That was wrong in the same way, one
step quieter, and the two defects it caused are the entry immediately below.
Read both together; this one is not the whole story.

---

### 2026-09-13 — deleting three invented numbers left a fourth behind, and made a second agreeing analyst LOWER a stock's rank (found on adversarial review of PR #348, before merge)

**In plain words.** The fix above removed three made-up "how strongly does
this specialist lean" numbers and set those seats to a single flat value
instead. Two things were wrong with it, and both were caught by reviewing the
change against the desk's own stated edge rather than against its own
reasoning.

**Defect 1 — agreement became dilutive. This is the serious one.** The desk
scores a stock by AVERAGING its specialists' scores. Averaging means a second
specialist who AGREES can pull the average down, and after the flat value was
introduced that stopped being a corner case and became the normal case.
Reproduced against the code, exact arithmetic:

  * technical says `strong_buy` at high confidence, on its own:
    lean 1.0 + confidence 1.0 = **2.0**.
  * add smart_money saying `actionable` — the strongest thing that seat can
    say, agreeing on direction — and the average of the two leans falls to
    0.8, scoring **1.8**.

A second analyst, agreeing, made the stock rank LOWER. That contradicts the
desk's own stated edge — breadth x consistency x asymmetry — and
`docs/OUTCOME.md` §9.4's "agreement earns size". It was not a tuning problem.
An average answers "how enthusiastic is the average specialist covering this
name", which is a question nobody asked and which the edge statement never
mentions.

**The fix: the aggregation is now a SUM, not an average.** Chosen because it
follows from the edge rather than because it produced nicer numbers:

  * It introduces NO number. It deletes a divisor. Every constant left in the
    arithmetic was already ratified and is unchanged.
  * It is monotone by construction — every added term is a positive weight
    times two non-negative signals — so "an agreeing seat can only add" stops
    being a property somebody has to remember to test and becomes a property
    of the arithmetic.
  * Disagreement cannot leak into it: a stock whose specialists disagree on
    direction is already dropped whole, before any scoring happens.

The reward-to-risk tiebreak deliberately stays an average. It combines several
estimates of ONE quantity in a real unit; two specialists both reading 2.0 do
not make 4.0. Evidence adds, measurements average.

**Defect 2 — 0.5 was not a derivation either.** The flat value was
Technical's `buy` rung, borrowed by four seats that have no rungs — which is
the whole reason they were in this fix. Borrowing is not deriving. The four
seats now carry ZERO stated strength (`NO_STATED_STRENGTH`), which is the
honest encoding of "states no distance", and they reach the ranking through
their weighted confidence alone. This only became a coherent option once the
aggregation was a sum: under the old average a zero would have dragged an
agreeing stock down, which is exactly why 0.5 looked necessary at the time.

**Two consequences of the sum, stated rather than discovered later.** The
score is no longer capped at 2.0 and is not comparable to a score recorded
before today. And coverage now moves the score: a name with a live earnings
filing and a confirmed institutional flow outranks an otherwise identical name
with only a chart, and it falls back when that coverage lapses. That is the
intended reading of breadth, but it means `src/rotation.py`'s comparison of a
held name against a new one is now partly a comparison of how much coverage
each has today. The margin is a ratio so the change of scale does not affect
it; coverage decay on a held name does. Flagged as `docs/WORK.md` item 63, not
silently absorbed.

**A third finding, verified and INTENDED but undisclosed in the original
change.** The sector fix in the entry above has a consequence nobody wrote
down. Macro's verdict used to be the broad market read for every stock, so an
energy name Technical liked, on a session with a negative broad read, was
dropped from the ranking as an unadjudicated disagreement. Now the read
resolves on the sector's own rows, and when those rows contradict each other
the result is "no opinion" — which the ranking skips, so there is no
disagreement left to drop the stock for, and it reaches the decision-maker.
Verified against the code, both before and after.

That behaviour is right: the desk's belief about that sector is genuinely
unresolved, and an unresolved read is an absence of an opinion, not a
disagreement. Dropping a stock on the strength of a broad outlook its own
sector rows contradict was the bug. What was not acceptable was doing it
invisibly. So a specialist that looked and came back with nothing is now
recorded on the candidate and printed in the decision-maker's prompt — "no
lean from: macro" — because "this seat looked and found nothing" and "this
seat never looked" were previously indistinguishable downstream.

**What is still open.** Whether these four seats should have a real strength
scale of their own at all is not settled by deleting the fake one. It cannot
be answered by choosing a number and it must not be answered by fitting one to
the desk's history. It is `docs/WORK.md` item 62.

**The lesson.** The first fix was right about what to delete and wrong about
what to leave. Deleting an invented number is only half the job; the other
half is checking what the SHAPE around it then does, and checking it against
the desk's stated edge rather than against the change's own reasoning. Here
the shape had been quietly wrong the whole time and the deletion only made it
visible — the average was already dilutive whenever a weaker-leaning seat
agreed, before any of this.

### 2026-09-13 — the schedule that prices "how many analysts agree" has rungs nobody derived, and four of its five rungs cannot bind anything (item 30 finding, NOT resolved — owner decision)

**In plain words:** the desk allows a bigger position when more of its
specialists agree. It does this with a five-step ladder: one net specialist
in favour allows 3% of the account at risk, two allows 4%, three or more
allows 5%. Item 30 asked whether that ladder should start weighting some
specialists more heavily than others, the way the *ranking* step recently
started doing. Reading the code turns that into a different question, because
two things are true that the item did not record.

**First: the ladder's own steps were never derived from anything.** The
measurement cited beside them measured how OFTEN each step would be reached —
across 75 real targets, 67% had exactly one net specialist behind them, 29%
had two, 4% had three, none had four or five. That is a coverage count. It
says which step matters most; it says nothing about what any step should BE.
The stated reasoning only fixes a *range* for the first step: near 5% and the
ladder does nothing, much under 2% and it shrinks nine trades in ten to a
token. 3% and 4% sit inside that range by choice. So the ladder is a chosen
shape, not a read one — which means weighting the count that indexes it would
mean inventing an interpolation rule to look up a table whose entries were
already invented. That compounds the problem rather than fixing it.

**Second: four of the five steps cannot currently reduce anything.** The
desk's hard per-trade ceiling is 5% and the decision-maker's own instructions
cap what it may ask for at 4%. So the three-, four- and five-specialist steps
(all 5%) sit at or above the hard ceiling and can never bite, and the
two-specialist step (4%) can only bite on a request the prompt already
forbids. Exactly one step — the single-specialist 3% — can ever reduce a
position, and only for a request between 3% and 4%. This became true when the
conviction bands were restored (item 32); it was not true when the ladder was
written, and nobody re-checked.

**Third, and this is the part that settles the original question: a per-seat
weight in the sizing path is already forbidden by a ratified rule with a
mechanical guard behind it.** The desk's standing rule is that a confidence
weight may only be DERIVED from measured history, never chosen up front, with
the minimum set at 20 resolved calls per seat; the book is nowhere near that
and the closed round-trips it does have record no conviction at all, so there
is nothing to derive from (the exact count was not re-measured here — the
spec's own figure was single digits). A test fails if
anyone introduces a per-seat weight table into the sizing score, and it fails
on symmetry as well as on the constant, so a table that averages to one is
caught too. The 2026-09-03 owner amendment that let the RANKING use a
published prior was scoped, in the owner's own decision, to the ranking
module and explicitly left this one alone.

**So the code was left alone, deliberately.** Not because equal weights are
right, but because changing them is not an engineering decision available
here: it needs the owner to extend that amendment, and even then the thing it
would index has no derivation behind it. The live incoherence item 30 names
is real — the desk ranks on one belief about whose opinion counts and sizes
on another — but porting the weights across would not remove it, because the
two paths disagree structurally and not just numerically: ranking scores a
per-seat strength-plus-confidence composite, sizing counts seats as plus-one
/ minus-one votes and reads a step function. Matching the numbers leaves them
still measuring different things.

**What is actually left for the owner** is written into `docs/WORK.md` item
30: not "which weights", but whether a chosen five-step ladder should be
pricing size at all when four of its steps are inert and none of the five was
read from anything.

### 2026-09-13 — can the desk still die quietly? Every way it can produce nothing, enumerated (item 11 closed)

**In plain words:** item 11 recorded a day the desk produced no trade ideas at
all because of technical failures, and nobody noticed, because a broken desk
and a quiet market look identical from outside. The item's real content was
never the failures of that one day — it was the premise that *a failure can be
silent*. So the question that closes it is not "was 2026-08-25 fixed" but "can
the desk still go quiet without telling anyone". Every way it can produce
nothing was enumerated and each alarm was read in the code that actually sends
it. One path was genuinely uncovered; it was closed the same day. The
enumeration below is the durable artefact and is why the item can go.

**One path was open, and the noise guard had just opened it.** Earlier the
same day, the silence watchdog's runner gained a guard so it stays quiet while
the desk is deliberately paused — correct in itself; an alarm that pages every
thirty minutes about a state somebody chose gets muted. But it exited in
silence, and nothing else covers a paused desk: the daily channel probe sends
its test message and deletes it, so a healthy day is invisible to the owner by
design; the stop-coverage watchdog only speaks when a held position is short of
stops; the alert channel's `stale` state is a colour on Mission Control that
nobody is pushed. A paused desk with a flat book was therefore indistinguishable
from a working desk in a quiet market — item 11's own premise, reintroduced by
the guard meant to reduce noise. The desk was in exactly that state when this
was checked. Fixed: the silence *check* stays suppressed while paused, and a
reminder goes out once per ET weekday instead, only after one of that day's
scheduled windows has closed. Neither the cadence nor the gate is a new number
— the once-every-24-hours-while-it-stays-broken rule is the existing item 41
ruling already used by the stop-coverage watchdog, and the window gate is read
off the session schedule.

**The enumeration. Each alarm was traced to the line that sends it, not taken
from a docstring.**

| How the desk produces nothing | What tells somebody | Where |
|---|---|---|
| No session at all — timers off, box down, service dead | Desk-wide silence alert after 2 consecutive scheduled windows with no completed session, in any mode. Fires on the ABSENCE of events, so a broken alert path cannot defeat it | `src/silence_watchdog.py` |
| Desk deliberately paused, then forgotten | **WAS THE HOLE.** Now a once-per-weekday paused-desk reminder, after the day's first window closes | `src/silence_watchdog.py` (`check_paused_desk`), `scripts/run_silence_heartbeat.sh` |
| Box itself dead or unreachable | **NOT COVERED, owner-accepted.** Nothing running on the box can report the box. An external ping would cover it; the owner refused that dependency outright, so the gap is stated, not closed | stated in `src/alert_watchdog.py` |
| Session runs, pipeline raises anywhere | Every path out of a session hits one `finally` that pushes a `FAILED:` message with the exception, and separately proves the alert channel and records the verdict | `main.py`, `src/notifier.py`, `src/alert_watchdog.py` |
| PM never produced a usable decision (parse, schema, grounding fault) | Distinct `pm_*` / `analysis_error` status, rendered as its own banner saying *no decisions were made; this is NOT a deliberate hold* — written precisely so it cannot read as a quiet day | `src/pipeline.py`, `src/notifier.py` |
| An analyst seat returned junk or nothing | Standalone data-quality alert, never a line buried in the run summary | `src/notifier.py` (`maybe_alert_data_quality`) |
| A whole session never fired on a trading day | Evening dead-man's check names the missing session, with two sharper probes for a morning that started and died mid-run | `src/pipeline.py` (`_expected_sessions_missing_today`) |
| The data was empty — dead bar feed wearing the costume of a quiet market | Owner alert when the share of symbols with no bars, or no structural level, crosses the threshold (min sample 10, so a tiny universe is correctly treated as noise) | `src/pipeline_stages.py` (`_persist_levels_coverage`) |
| Cost circuit latched — paid analysis durably off | Session status `paid_analysis_suspended` with a SUSPENDED banner naming the trigger, plus a dedicated alert whose delivery outcome is written into the latch file and retried by any later process until it lands | `src/cost_circuit.py`, `src/notifier.py` |
| Kill switch left on | Every session returns `kill_switch_halted`, the one status that speaks even on an otherwise-silent intra_check tick | `src/pipeline.py`, `src/notifier.py` |
| Proposals made, every one refused | Distinguished **in the status word**: `no_trades` means the PM proposed nothing, `no_orders` means a plan existed and nothing was submitted, `buys_unfunded` means approved buys lost a cash race. Three different words for three different days | `src/pipeline.py`, `src/notifier.py` |
| Alert channel itself broken while the box lives | Every session probes the channel end to end and records the verdict; `broken` / `stale` show on Mission Control without Telegram working | `src/alert_watchdog.py` |
| An alarm's own systemd unit never installed, edited by hand, or not enabled | Unit-drift check compares installed units against the deployed checkout byte for byte, in four buckets including `not_enabled` | `scripts/check_unit_drift.py` |

**Two honest limits recorded rather than papered over.** First, a persistent
all-refused condition — a gate defect that refuses everything every day —
reports `no_orders` truthfully each session but nothing escalates on the
repetition; the day is distinguishable, the *pattern* is not alarmed. That is a
judgement about how many identical quiet days should trigger a page, which is a
threshold the owner has not set, so no number was invented for it. Second, this
enumeration was done by reading the repository. Whether each unit is actually
installed and running on the box could not be verified from here — no
`quant-agent` user units are visible from this environment and its database file
is empty, so this is not the live box. The unit-drift check exists precisely
because a repo carrying a unit is not the same as a box running it.

**What was ruled out.** That item 11 could be closed because the watchdogs
exist. It could not: reading the pause guard is what found the hole, and the
guard's own docstring described it as safe.

**Corrected in passing.** The silence alert and its CLI still told the reader
its threshold was "a placeholder pending owner confirmation". It was ratified
2026-09-03; the sentence outlived the fact.

---



### 2026-09-13 — the risk reviewer was told, on every exit review, that the analyst had skipped two mandatory checks. It had not; those checks do not exist on that path. It then wrote that falsehood into the permanent audit trail.

**In plain words:** the same AI risk seat reviews two different things — the
morning's new purchases, and the decisions to SELL positions the desk already
holds. It was only ever set up for the first job. When the sell-side review
reused it, the seat was handed a form with two boxes unfilled, and its
standing instructions read an unfilled box as "the analyst skipped a mandatory
safety check". Nobody had skipped anything: those two boxes belong to a
different analyst's form and cannot exist on the sell side. The seat believed
it, said so, and the statement is now permanently in the desk's own records.

**What the record proves, and what it does not.** The archive holds exactly
three exit-path risk reviews (row 296 — 2026-08-31 19:32:50, run
`close-100065e1`; rows 319 and 330 — 2026-09-01). *[Date corrected
2026-09-14: this read "rows 296, 319, 330 — 2026-09-01". Row 296 is the
2026-08-31 close, not the 2026-09-01 one. Nothing else in this entry turns on
it — the count, the approvals and the 8-of-8 all re-verified against the same
archive.]* All three
carry both false banners. All three **approved**, with zero modifications and
zero refusals: 8 of 8 exits allowed. The seat talked itself out of the trap
every time; row 296 wrote that the missing steps "are a concern for PM's
internal discipline, but the plan itself is sound". So the natural claim —
that this made the seat refuse exits — is **not supported by the record**, and
was overstated in the first draft of this fix. Three reviews is also far too
small a sample to show there is no such bias. Both of those are true.

**The harm that IS proven is to the audit trail.** Rows 319 and 330 wrote the
falsehood into their own permanent `overall` field. Row 330: "both
continuity_check and premortem_check are MISSING — the two mandatory red-team
steps were skipped", and it set `reason_category: "data_degraded"` on that
basis — a tag the Portfolio Manager reads back to self-calibrate its sizing.
The system recorded, permanently and untruthfully, that an analyst skipped a
safety check, and fed that record into a live feedback loop.

**Why the direction still matters even unpaid.** Refusing a BUY means not
buying, which costs nothing. Refusing a SELL leaves the position on the book
overnight with only the broker stop behind it, and `docs/OUTCOME.md` records
under-trading as this desk's measured failure. The cost is asymmetric whether
or not it has been paid yet.

**The real cause, and what it was not.** Not a bug in the renderer — its
[MISSING] banner is correct on the morning path, where an empty field really
does mean PM skipped a step its own prompt makes mandatory while the schema
lets it return "". The cause was that the exit call site reused a renderer
built for a different caller and a different schema, then papered over the
mismatch: it wrote the literal string `"n/a"` into six chain fields and a
cross-reference sentence into two more, to satisfy a `min_length=1`
constraint. A fabricated "n/a" reads to the seat as a real answer to a
question nobody answered. That substitution is where the defect started, and
it is why the fix uses no placeholders.

**A finding worth its own decision: the banner has never once been right.**
Across the 14 archived MORNING risk reviews the banner has fired **zero**
times — PM has never actually skipped either step. *[Count corrected
2026-09-14: this read "15". The archive holds 17 `risk_manager` rows in
`agent_logs`, three of which are the exit reviews above, so the morning count
is 14. The banner string "NOT PERFORMED" appears in the stored `input_message`
of exactly those three rows and none of the fourteen, so the "fired zero
times" claim is unaffected — only the denominator was wrong.]* Its entire production
output to date is the three false statements above. On the evidence, deleting
it outright is the better fix than routing around it. It was left standing
because removing it changes the morning seat's behaviour on a case that has
not yet occurred, which is a separate decision with a separate blast radius.
Recorded here so the next person does not have to re-derive it.

**What was done.** The seat is now told which review it is in. On the exit path
the two PM-only audit steps are not rendered at all; the chain is labelled as
the position reviewer's, under its own field names (its execution rationale had
been audited under the heading "Sizing logic"); the Tech block, which no call
on this loop produces, says it is unavailable by design rather than "(not
provided)"; and the `$0.0` entry/stop/target are explained as structural zeros
rather than looking like a data fault.

Three further corrections came out of adversarial review of the first draft,
each of which had introduced or left a false statement of its own:

- **The event-risk checklist inverts on this path, and the fix had activated
  it.** Checklist 4 says a fetched earnings date inside the window means
  "downsize or reject". Adding a real earnings fetch here — which the fix does
  — gave that instruction something to fire on for the first time. On an entry,
  refusing means carrying *less* risk through the event; on an exit, refusing
  means carrying the position *through* it. Same words, opposite effect. The
  seat is now told to answer `event_risk` but never to cite event proximity as
  a reason to refuse an exit.
- **Holding discipline was stood down using its own justification against
  it.** Checklist 8 exists precisely *because* the deterministic check runs
  after the review. The first draft confirmed that ordering and then cited it
  as "already covered". Restored, and it is now named as the substance of the
  seat's job here.
- **The four Python gates are much narrower than they read.** The trigger gate
  checks that the reason says recognised words, not that the claim is true. The
  noise band is bypassed whenever the reason cites external information, which
  the trigger gate all but requires. The metric-contradiction veto does not run
  without recorded prior metrics for that symbol. `holding_discipline_claim_check`
  examines only a claimed regime flip or a claimed HIGH-conviction bearish state
  change, only while the position is still structurally protected, and passes
  every unverifiable claim by design. None of them can catch a plausibly-worded,
  deterministically-clean, wrong exit. The seat is now told exactly that,
  instead of being handed a list of coverage that does not exist.

**A lever that was never connected.** `modifications` and `scale_all_buys` are
discarded on the exit path — `_apply_risk_modifications` is called only from
the morning stage, and the exit verdict is consumed for `rejected_symbols`
alone. The seat had been receiving detailed guidance on editing `allocation_pct`
here, guidance for a mechanism with no effect: the same class of false
statement this whole change exists to remove. It is now told plainly that
refusal is its only lever and that the exit fraction is the position reviewer's
call, not its own. Wiring modifications through instead was rejected as scope:
the exit path executes from the reviewer's own action list, not from the
translated decisions the seat sees, so applying an edit would need a new
translation layer — and the edit it would most naturally make is to shrink an
exit, which is the dangerous direction.

**And what was simply never passed.** Everything the loop had already fetched
before the position reviewer ran, then did not forward: today's news, earnings,
deployable cash and the parked reserve, drawdown state, and holding ages. All
now passed. Earnings proximity is additionally fetched here, bounded by the
same timeouts the morning path uses. Genuinely unavailable on this path: Tech
signals, and the macro-release and FOMC calendars (fetched by the morning
research stage, which does not run on this loop) — those keep the labelled NOT
FETCHED form, which is honest.

**A wrong claim in the code, corrected while in there.** `_risk_review_exits`
documented itself as running *after* the deterministic exit gates. It does
not: all four live in `_midday_execute_llm_actions`, which the caller invokes
afterwards. They still run before anything reaches the broker, so the
substantive point — that they, not this seat, are the last line — stands. Only
the ordering claim was false, and that ordering is exactly why checklist 8 had
to be restored.

**On length.** The added instruction is a real cost with no way to measure the
benefit: there is no rig here that can validate a prompt rewrite. Archived exit
prompts ran 7,775-8,428 characters; the first draft added 4,860 characters of
mostly negative instruction. After cutting what the corrections above made
redundant, the overhead is 3,558 and pinned by test so it cannot drift.

**What would catch it next time.** The rule is written where the rendering
happens and pinned by test: *never tell the seat a check was skipped when that
check does not apply to the path it is on, and never tell it to verify against
a block that is absent by construction — or to use a lever that is not
connected.* The tests assert the exit message carries no NOT-PERFORMED banner,
that the morning path still carries both when genuinely earned, and that the
two renderings are byte-identical when no review mode is given.

### 2026-09-13 — a "close enough to the level" tolerance was measured in the wrong unit, and was narrower than the thing it claimed to cover on every ordinary stock

**In plain words:** when the desk decides whether a stop is sitting *on* a
support level, it has to allow some slack, because a level is a band of
prices, not a single number — the desk builds each level by merging together
past bounces that fall within one percent of each other. The slack it allowed
was written down in a completely different unit: a fraction of the stock's
daily trading range, rather than a percentage of its price. The note beside
the setting claimed the slack was "at least as wide" as that one-percent band.
It was not. On a typical stock it was about two thirds as wide, so a stop
placed inside a level's real band was judged not to be on the level at all.
The desk then pushed that stop wider, off the structure the analyst had
chosen, and sized the trade against the worse number. Nothing crashed and no
money was visibly lost; the trades were just quietly worse than intended.

**The arithmetic, which is the whole finding.** The slack was `0.25 x ATR`
(ATR being the stock's own average daily range). The level band is `1% of
price`. Setting them equal:

    0.25 x ATR >= 0.01 x price   <=>   ATR >= 4.0% of price

So the written justification was not a fact about the setting at all — it was
a hidden condition on the *stock*. It held only on names moving 4% or more a
day. This desk's own comments quote a median ATR of 2.56% of price (measured
against the live book on 2026-08-27, recorded in prose in
`docs/QAMC_REMEDIATION_SPEC.md`), at which the slack is 0.64% of price against
a 1% band — 1.56x too narrow. Verified by direct read of both numbers and both
consumers, not taken from the audit note.

**Why it mattered beyond tidiness.** A stop that counts as level-backed is
exempt from the ATR stop floor. Failing the match therefore does not just
change a label: it moves the stop, which changes the trade's reward:risk and
its position size, because size is `risk% x entry / (entry - stop)`. This fed
straight into the reward:risk geometry the desk was already fixing.

**What was ruled out.** Re-tuning the multiple. There is no ATR multiple that
can be correct, because the quantity it is being compared against is a
percentage of price and the ratio between the two is a different number for
every name on every day — any value picked would have been a number fitted to
one volatility and wrong at every other. Choosing a new "1.5%" or "0.4 ATR"
would have been exactly the invented constant this desk has banned.

**What was actually done.** The setting was deleted, not replaced. The match
now reads the tolerance off the level's own zone, derived from the very same
clustering constant that built that zone, so the tolerance is by construction
exactly as wide as the thing it is matching against. Two numbers became one,
and they can no longer disagree because there is only one of them. The
tolerance is no longer configurable and a settings file still carrying the old
key is now refused loudly rather than ignored — the same pattern already used
for other deleted keys, because a silently-ignored risk setting is how an
operator ends up believing a value they set is in force.

**The ATR argument was not wrong, it was misfiled.** "Is this stop far enough
out to survive this name's noise" genuinely is a volatility question, and it
is still asked, by `min_stop_atr_multiple` and `absolute_min_stop_atr_multiple`.
"Is this stop decisively through the level" is also a volatility question, and
still uses the ATR noise band. "Which level is this stop sitting on" is an
identity question about a band defined in percent, and now gets answered in
percent. The original comment collapsed all three into one number.

**What would catch it next time.** The general lesson is a unit check, not a
value check: whenever a comment says one number is "at least as wide as"
another, confirm the two are in the same unit first — if they are not, the
sentence is a claim about the instrument, not about the setting, and it will
be true for some names and false for others. `tests/test_level_match_zone.py`
now pins the relationship directly, reproduces the old arithmetic including
the 4%-ATR crossover, checks the two independent implementations of the match
rule agree at the boundary, and fails if the deleted key or a second copy of
the clustering constant reappears anywhere in the tree.

**One thing left honestly unresolved.** The 1% clustering width itself
(`CLUSTER_TOLERANCE_PCT`) carries no derivation — its comment says only that
price respects a zone rather than a number. That is a separate, still-open
question about what a level zone's real width is, and it was deliberately not
answered here. This change makes the match tolerance *consistent* with that
width; it does not claim the width is right. Nothing was invented to paper
over it.

### 2026-09-13 — the whole-plan veto: what actually caused it, and the two holes left in the fix (item 7)

**In plain words:** the AI risk reviewer can refuse a whole day's plan rather
than one trade in it. Item 7 recorded this as still happening after a fix had
been written for it. Checked against the archived database, that is not what
happened, and the item's own cause was wrong.

**The measurement, preserved here because deleting the item deletes it.**
Item 7 read "2 of 68 (3%)". That count comes from
`scripts/blocked_proposals_census.py`, which counts PROPOSALS, not sessions:
the single veto it refers to covered a decision with three targets, one of
which had already been dropped, so it attributes two. Counted as SESSIONS
there were four refusals in the 2026-08-18 to 2026-09-02 archive, and the two
numbers do not contradict each other.

**What each refusal was actually for.** Only ONE of the four was the
incoherence case — 2026-08-31 19:08, where the plan's narrative argued for a
symbol deterministic code had already removed, and the reviewer refused the
whole plan as inconsistent, killing two trades it had just called valid. The
other three cited the flat 1.5 reward:risk floor by name. So the dominant
cause of this item was never incoherence; it was item 1's floor.

**It did not reproduce.** The fix (`311efce0`, telling the reviewer what was
removed) was authored 20:25 and first reachable on `main` at 20:31 that
evening — after both of that day's refusals. The one later refusal, on
2026-09-01, ran with the fix live: its recorded input contains the "Removed
Before You Saw This" section verbatim. It refused on the reward:risk floor,
not on coherence.

**Two real holes, both found by adversarial review and both fixed here.**

  * *The reviewer was still being told a floor existed.* The floor stopped
    being a gate on 2026-09-11, and a later pass claimed to have retired it
    "from every place still describing it" — but this seat's own briefing
    still called 1.5 "the number ... to enforce" and told it that sub-floor
    orders "have already been refused deterministically". Both false. That
    text is the direct cause of three of the four refusals in the archive and
    it was live on `main` until today.
  * *The removed-symbols list was computed too early.* It was frozen right
    after construction, but the order list is filtered at least three more
    times before the review — the symbol guard, the queued-earnings clamp and
    the hard-risk gate — and each can remove some names and pass the rest
    through. A symbol struck by one of those was missing from the order list
    AND missing from the removed list, which is the 2026-08-31 failure exactly,
    on a path the original fix never covered. It is now recomputed immediately
    before the review. The note also no longer asserts WHICH rule removed a
    symbol, because it cannot know — the durable per-symbol reason is already
    recorded in the evidence trail.

**What actually addresses the item's stated cost.** Item 7's complaint was
that one refusal discards every trade, so the cost is superlinear. The thing
that fixes that is per-symbol refusal (`b1b31bf5`, 2026-09-01) — a failing
trade now dies alone. The reviewer can still fail closed and refuse a whole
plan when repair itself fails, and that is deliberate.

**Honest limit.** The desk has been paused since 2026-09-03, so there is one
post-fix session in the record. This is closed on the timestamps and on the
two repairs above, not on a re-measure.

### 2026-09-13 — "correlation breach" was a password, not a reason, and has been removed from the accepted exit vocabulary

**In plain words:** to sell a position it is supposed to keep holding, the
desk's AI has to name a reason from a short accepted list. One of those
reasons — "correlation breach" — was accepted on the wording alone. Nothing
anywhere in the desk ever worked out whether correlations had actually broken,
so the phrase always worked. It was the one entry on the list that could not
fail. It has been taken off the list.

**What the audit found, and one thing it got wrong.** The audit (WORK.md item
44) reported that the claim reached the holding-discipline checker and came
back "unverifiable by construction", which by design passes without blocking.
That is not what happened. The checker has no branch for a correlation claim
at all — it only ever examines a claimed regime flip and a claimed
HIGH-conviction bearish state change. A correlation claim returned the plain
"ok" verdict, meaning *nothing to say*. So the phrase was not merely
unverified, it was **unrecorded**: an "unverifiable" verdict at least writes an
audit-trail row a human could later read, and a correlation exit wrote none.
The hole was one notch deeper than the item described.

**Why removal rather than building a detector.** The item concluded that
building a verifier requires deciding which correlation, over what window,
and how large a change counts as broken — three numbers — and that this was
therefore an owner decision. That conclusion conflicts with the owner's own
standing instruction never to be asked to pick a market-structure number:
research the published literature, or leave the thing switched off. So the
literature was searched before anything was written.

**What the search found.** No published source consulted gives an operational
definition of a correlation-breakdown *event* with a stated measurement window
and a stated numeric threshold:

- AnalystPrep's FRM Part 2 note on correlation basics and correlation risk
  (fetched 2026-09-13) defines correlation risk conceptually — a loss arising
  because realised correlation differed from anticipated correlation — and
  gives no window, no threshold, and no trigger point.
- *Notes on Correlation Stress Tests* (arXiv 2503.16200, fetched 2026-09-13)
  addresses stress-testing correlation assumptions rather than declaring
  breakdown events, and states no such definition.
- The contagion literature the search surfaced — Forbes & Rigobon, *No
  Contagion, Only Interdependence* (2002), and Longin & Solnik (2001) on
  extreme correlation — tests whether correlation *changed* around a crisis
  date that is supplied from outside the test, retrospectively, with a
  heteroskedasticity adjustment. That is a research question about a period
  already known to have been a crisis. It is not, and cannot be turned into,
  a same-day per-position exit trigger.
- What the search did surface with concrete numbers were vendor charting
  indicators with user-configurable lookback, stability window and threshold
  inputs. Configurable is the opposite of derived: those are the three
  invented numbers the owner's rule forbids, wearing a product name.

**The second, independent reason.** Even a correlation you could measure is
computed *from the price series*. `exit_guard` kept a separate list of
triggers that come from OUTSIDE the tape, which are allowed to bypass the
1×ATR noise band on the grounds that an earnings miss is an earnings miss
whatever the price did. "Correlation breach" was on that list and never
belonged there: a correlation number *is* the tape. So the phrase was also
buying a noise-band bypass it had no claim to.

**Ruled out.** Reusing the desk's existing cluster machinery was considered
and rejected. `src/data/correlation.py` groups holdings into |r| >= 0.7
clusters at decision time; it has no notion of a break, only of a grouping.
Its 0.7 cutoff is itself carried in the repo with no source behind it, so
building a breach detector on top of it would have compounded one unsourced
number rather than replacing it. Also rejected: keeping the phrase but
logging it. A logged free pass is still a free pass.

**What changed.** Both phrasings were removed from the hard-trigger
vocabulary in the pipeline and from the external-information list in
`exit_guard`, and from the position-reviewer prompt so the model is not being
invited to emit a phrase that will now be dropped. The exit-reason
*categoriser* in the storage layer deliberately still recognises them, because
it describes rows that already exist and dropping the phrases there would
silently re-label historical exits as uncategorised.

**What would catch it next time.** The general shape of this defect is an
accepted claim with no corresponding recorded fact. Every other entry on the
trigger list names something the desk writes down — a news row, an earnings
row, a macro regime read, a broker fill, a deterministic circuit breaker.
That is the test to apply before adding a trigger: name the row that proves
it happened. `tests/test_correlation_breach_not_a_trigger.py` pins the
removal, the noise-band classification, the fact that no other trigger was
narrowed, and the end-to-end exit that used to slip through.


### 2026-09-13 — a comment claimed two parts of the desk agreed on what a "swing low" is; they never have, and the research says nobody can say which is right

**What broke, plainly.** Two parts of the desk look for the same shape on a
chart: a dip with higher prices on both sides. The trailing stop requires
three higher days either side. The support-level finder requires five. A note
written beside the trailing stop said the two matched, so that a swing low
meant the same thing everywhere. It was false the day it was written and
stayed false for as long as it existed. Nothing lost money; a sentence lied.

**What was actually wrong, and what was not.** The false comment was real.
The alarm attached to it was not. The item said the mismatch meant one half
of the desk could protect a floor the other half did not believe in. That
requires something downstream to compare the two, and nothing does — checked
by reading every module that imports either one. The trailing window is used
only by the trailing stop's own pivot scan; the level window is used only by
the level scan and the coverage check. They never meet. So this was a
documentation defect wearing a safety defect's clothes.

**One claim in the item is wrong and is corrected here.** It said each
window could see a low the other misses, "and vice versa". Measured, the
asymmetry runs one way: a bar that dominates five bars either side
necessarily dominates three, so every support pivot the level scan finds is
also a swing low the trailing stop finds. The looser window is the trailing
one, which sees strictly more. That is the safer direction of the two and is
now pinned by a test.

**Why the numbers were not reconciled.** The obvious fix — make both 3, or
both 5 — is picking a number, which this desk does not do. So the literature
was read first, and it does not support picking one:

* TA-Lib's own `FRACTAL` function takes left and right arms as parameters
  and defaults both to **2**, with no rationale stated on the page. Two
  either side is the classic five-candle fractal — which is neither 3 nor 5,
  so the desk's two constants both already disagree with the archetype's
  default.
* MetaTrader 5's fractal documentation defines the pattern as five
  successive bars with two lower highs on both sides, and gives no reason
  for the count.
* Bill Williams did not require five. Five became standard because it
  shipped as a default indicator in MetaTrader 4. That is a distribution
  fact, not a measurement.
* LuxAlgo's swing high/low reference says it outright: there is no
  universally best setting, and different settings produce genuinely
  different structure from the same chart.

Roughly all of this literature is assertion rather than measurement. No
source fetched offered a derivation for any window, and the one source that
addressed the question directly said no derivation exists. The old comment
beside the level scan's 5 ("smaller values produce noise, larger ones miss
real turning points") looked like a justification but was the generic
sensitivity tradeoff that applies to any window at all — it justifies
nothing about 5 specifically, and it has been relabelled.

**What was done.** The archetype was adopted and the constants were not.
Both windows keep their existing values, each now labelled in its own file as
a convention with no derivation, with the fetched sources cited beside the
number, the consumers of each named so a future reader can check the
"they never meet" claim without re-deriving it, and an explicit instruction
not to "fix" the disagreement by copying. A test file pins all of it,
including a scan that fails if any module ever imports both windows — the
event that would turn this back into a real defect.

**A third instance of the same false claim** was found in the trailing-stop
test suite, whose fixture docstring also said the definition matched the
level scan's. Fixed with the other two.

**What would catch it next time.** Nothing did catch it, for months, because
a comment cannot be executed. The test that now asserts what the comments say
is the mechanism; the general lesson is that a comment claiming two constants
agree is a claim about code and should be pinned like one.

### 2026-09-12 — opportunity-cost rotation stopped only describing the problem and started acting on it, and was enabled rather than shipped dark

**In plain words:** the desk could already see when money was tied up in a
weak holding while a stronger idea was being refused for "no room". All it
did was say so in the decision-maker's briefing. It never freed the money.
It now does — it can close one held position per morning session so the
better idea can be taken.

**Why the surfacing-only version was not enough.** The 2026-09-04 design
(recorded above under item 39) deliberately only surfaced the comparison,
on the reasoning that a model reading the comparison would act on it. It
did not: the note is information competing with everything else in the
prompt, and a refused candidate stays refused whatever the briefing says.
The capital stayed where it was.

**What acts now, and the five preconditions that each fail closed.** At
most ONE held position is closed per morning session, and only when all
five hold, each read from data rather than chosen:

1. The book's existing risk leaves less headroom than the minimum
   tradeable size — a half-empty book never triggers rotation at all.
2. The holding fails the desk's own entry rules TODAY, so the comparison
   is categorical rather than a rank wobble that reverses tomorrow.
3. Its structural protection has ALREADY broken under the holding-discipline
   check — a position whose thesis is intact is never rotated out.
4. It was not bought today and has nothing in flight.
5. The decision-maker itself asked to BUY the best-ranked new candidate
   this session. The desk never invents the buy leg.

**Nothing bypasses the normal path.** The close is an ordinary zero-size
target appended through the SAME route as any other exit the
decision-maker asks for — no direct broker call, no separate close path,
so every existing guard still applies. Every execution alerts the owner,
and a SECOND alert fires if the sale happened and the buy leg then did
not, because that is the failure mode that leaves the desk worse off than
doing nothing.

**Enabled, not dark.** `rotation_enabled` was set true rather than shipped
behind an off flag — the owner's call. **Never executed against a live
broker:** the desk has been paused since roughly 2026-09-03, so the first
real rotation will also be its first end-to-end proof and should be
watched when trading resumes.

### 2026-09-12 — "no floor, no trade" shipped in the morning and was falsified by sourced research within hours; replaced by a stop-width gate the same day

**In plain words:** the desk had just been told to refuse any trade with no
support level beneath the entry, and to ignore a level sitting on the far
side of an unfilled gap. Both ideas sounded like discipline. Neither
survived contact with the published record, and the owner approved
replacing them before the rule had run a single live session.

**What the sources say, and where.** No published stop method refuses a
trade for lack of a level below: Chandelier (highest high minus 3 ATR),
Parabolic SAR, the Darvas box bottom and the entry-bar low all place a
stop with no level at all, and Darvas only bought stocks at new highs
(Kristjan Kullamägi, in his own words,
https://qullamaggie.com/my-3-timeless-setups-that-have-made-me-tens-of-millions/).
The gap branch was not merely unsupported but backwards, and this is
measured: Thomas Bulkowski finds a rising window supports price only 20%
of the time (16% in a bear market) and says outright that gaps do not
work well as support or resistance
(https://thepatternsite.com/SAR.html,
https://thepatternsite.com/GaugingGaps.html). Price passes through the gap
four times in five, which makes the pre-gap level more reachable, not
void; no source anywhere treats a pre-gap level as void — that premise
was this desk's own invention. Worst, the rule was adversely selected:
George and Hwang (2004, Journal of Finance) show that nearness to the
52-week high forecasts returns and dominates past returns as a predictor,
robust in 18 of 20 international markets
(https://www.bauer.uh.edu/tgeorge/papers/gh4-paper.pdf) — and a stock near
its high is exactly the stock with nothing computed beneath it. Measured
against the real universe the morning rule refused nine names, six of
them for the gap reason alone.

**What published practice constrains instead is the stop's width.**
Kullamägi: "stop should not be wider than the ATR or ADR of the stock".
The response to a wide stop is a smaller position — Van Tharp's sizing,
position = risk budget divided by distance to stop, which is arithmetic
rather than an empirical claim — not a refusal.

**What was done.** The floor requirement, its two refusal codes, the
PM-eligibility mirror and the gap-edge plumbing were deleted; the gap
detector stays as analyst context and nothing reads it as a rule. The
structured-refusal record the morning PR built (a refusal written as data
with its code, drained once per session, read by the census and the PM
digest as its own bucket) was kept and reused. A stop is now always
derivable, with no new mechanism: the ATR noise band that already widened
an unbacked stop now also places a missing one, and the wider of that
band and the signal bar's far edge is the fallback. The gate is on width,
refused by code. **The cap had to be chosen honestly, and it is not
Kullamägi's.** His one-day range would refuse this desk's own ratified
2.5-ATR fallback; the fallback band as cap would refuse every "wider stop,
smaller position" trade the ratified sizing rule requires (38 pinned tests
failed when that was tried). The only instrument-read width the desk
already had past both is the reach — ATR times the square root of the
horizon times the same 1.5 the target derivation and the level scan use —
the furthest price plausibly travels inside the trade. A stop past it
cannot be hit inside the trade, so the size computed from it is fiction.
The desk computes ATR, not ADR; the substitution is stated in the code.
One narrow refusal survives on different grounds: a listing with fewer
completed sessions than the analyst's own 200-session trend reference is
refused as too young to measure, checked first so it is named as such and
not filed as a dead-feed fault by PR #326's classification. (On merging
#326 the next day its coverage minimum was unified with the scan's own
14-bar precondition and its short-history fault state dropped as a
duplicate of this refusal — see the third entry of this date.)

**Verified, not assumed: sizing already shrinks as the stop widens.** The
risk-based path divides a fixed risk budget by the stop distance on every
risk-sized target. What clamps it afterwards is the single-name notional
ceiling (65% of equity, the owner's own setting — see the 2026-09-11
entry "a rule allowing one stock to be the whole account rested on a fact
that had already stopped being true"):
a tight stop stops growing the position there, and the risk actually
taken is then below the budget, which the order note says. Pre-existing
and recorded, not something this change introduced or fixed.

**Measured after the change,** same method as the morning (real universe,
real daily bars through the desk's own data path, the shipped code
imported): at a 20-session horizon 95 of 101 pass, 4 are refused on width
(MRVL, VLO, OKLO, NUE — a stop leaned on a floor 7.8 to 9.5 ATR away,
past the 6.7-ATR reach), 2 on history (DRAM at 112 bars, CBRS at 83), 0
data faults; at the 60-session cap 99 pass and only the 2 history
refusals remain. Flagged and not fixed: SNDK's series shows a $27.89 low
and a $1,633 close inside eighteen months — a corporate action or a data
error, not a market fact — and the rehearsal engine still declines a
trade with no level beneath it, a pre-existing divergence from the live
desk now stated in its code.

**What would catch it next time.** The morning rule went from owner
sentence to shipped code in one pass with no literature check. The desk's
standing rule that technical questions go to published doctrine, never to
training recall or to the owner's instinct, existed and was not applied.
`tests/test_stop_width_gate.py` pins the replacement: nothing refuses for
absent structure, the gap branch cannot be re-imported, a missing stop is
read from the instrument, the width refusal fires past the reach and is
recorded, a wider stop under the cap halves the shares at the same
dollars of risk, and a young listing is refused first under its own name.

### 2026-09-12 — the "is this price level relevant" window was a flat 40% nobody derived; it is now read from the stock's own volatility, and "no floor, no trade" is enforced on top of it

**In plain words:** when the desk scans a stock's history for prices it has
repeatedly bounced off, it only keeps the ones the stock could plausibly get
back to — otherwise a shelf from a $10 SPAC era would count as "support" for
a $42 stock. Until today "plausibly" meant "within 40% of the current
price". That number had no derivation and meant a different thing on every
stock: on a utility that moves 1% a day it is months of travel, on a name
that moves 8% a day it is a week. It did not matter much while these levels
only fed targets. It matters a great deal now, because the owner has ruled
that a trade with no support level beneath it is refused outright — and if
the window is too narrow for a volatile name, the desk refuses a good trade
for the wrong reason: the floor exists, we just did not look far enough.

**What replaced it, and where it came from.** The desk already had one
answer to "how far can this stock travel": the target derivation's own
reachability estimate, ATR x sqrt(sessions) x 1.5, which decides whether a
structural level is a reachable target. The level scan now uses that exact
function, evaluated at the 60-session horizon cap the desk already imposes
on every stated holding period — so the window is "the furthest any trade
this desk permits could go", about 11.6 ATRs. No new multiplier, no second
notion of reachable distance: every level the target derivation could ever
accept is inside the window by construction, and a level outside it could
be neither a target for any permitted horizon nor a stop. The window now
widens on a volatile name and narrows on a quiet one because ATR does.
Nothing was fitted to past outcomes (`docs/OUTCOME.md`, no arbitrary
numbers). Where the scan cannot measure an ATR (fewer than 14 usable bars)
it reports nothing rather than fall back to a distance it cannot justify.

**The rule enforced on top: no floor, no trade; no ceiling is fine.** What
the code did before, established by reading it: nothing required a floor.
Order construction refused only when the chart yielded no levels at all, or
when neither the PM nor the analyst had typed a stop. A long with six
resistances overhead and nothing beneath shipped — its unbacked stop was
pushed out to the ATR noise band, a distance rather than a level, which is
exactly the "pick a number and hope" the owner refuses to hold. The
backtest engine already declined that trade, so the live desk and its own
rehearsal disagreed. Now a trade with no computed level on the stop side of
its entry (below a long, above a short) is refused by name on both setup
types, at the PM-eligibility preview and at order construction, from the
one code path both share. Nothing overhead is required: a stock at new
highs has no ceiling by definition, its target is the measured move, and
the corresponding refusal stays unreachable. No timer and no gap-vs-pop
filter were added — the levels are re-read every session and a name
qualifies the day the chart shows a floor.

**Recorded as data, not as a log line.** The constructor's existing
per-symbol drop reasons are recovered by a regular expression over its own
log text, and several messages miss the pattern. This refusal is written to
a structured record on the constructor and filed by the decision stage
under its own event reason with the code beside it; the blocked-proposals
census and the PM-facing digest read it as its own bucket. It is
deliberately NOT a data fault: "could not compute levels" (short or dirty
history) is PR #326's separate classification and is refused earlier under
its own name.

**Measured, then ruled on — the gap case.** The first build was checked
against real numbers before it was described to the owner: on a $50 -> $80
gap from an established base, the gap itself inflates the measured ATR, so
on the gap day the pre-gap $50 shelf was still inside reach and the code
took it as the floor — 37% below, a trade at a tiny size. That was reported
rather than hidden, and the owner ruled the same day: *"A shelf $30 below,
on the far side of a gap the market has repriced through, isn't support
anyone is defending."* Price never traded through the gap, so nobody bought
or defended anything in that range; the level below it is a number on a
chart, and leaning a stop on it reintroduces exactly the "no defensible
stop" case the whole rule exists to prevent. So a structural level on the
far side of an unfilled gap does not count as a floor (mirrored for a short:
an unfilled down-gap disqualifies a ceiling). The gap is read from the chart
by the desk's one existing gap detector — the same unfilled gaps the
analyst's context block already reports — rather than a second definition;
a filled gap stops disqualifying anything automatically because the
condition is re-read each session, with no timer or decay. The refusal has
its own code so the census can tell "a floor exists only beyond the gap"
from "no levels at all" and "levels only overhead". Real numbers: gap day,
the $50.60 shelf is beyond the gap and the trade is refused; two and a half
weeks later a base at $74-80 has bounced twice off $75 and the $74.40 floor
above the gap qualifies. Inherited and flagged: the reused detector ignores
gaps under 2%, a pre-existing threshold never derived for this rule.

**Tests that would catch a regression:** `tests/test_no_floor_no_trade.py`
(a volatile name reaches a shelf a quiet one cannot; the scan's window is
byte-for-byte the target derivation's own reach; a long with levels only
overhead is refused and recorded; a short with levels only beneath the
same; a breakout label does not exempt a long; nothing overhead is never a
refusal; the census attributes the refusal by code; the gap case with real
numbers — refused on the gap day, qualifying on the base above it, and
re-qualifying the day the gap fills). Three fixture families that deliberately kept a stop unbacked
gained a distant floor so they still test widening rather than the new
refusal, and the backtest's hand-computed series gained a realistic daily
range so its $125 shelf is within the instrument's own reach.

### 2026-09-12 — a paused desk left part of a real position with no stop for six sessions, and every record called it "expected"

**In plain words:** the desk owns 5.3089 shares of Oracle. The broker will
only keep a lasting protective stop on whole shares, so the 5 whole shares
have a stop that survives the close and the 0.3089-share slice gets a
one-day stop that the desk puts back every morning. The desk was switched
off on 3 September and stayed off. Nobody connected "switched off" with
"nothing puts the morning stop back", so from 3 to 11 September the slice
(about $46 of a $798 position) had no stop at all, while the last report
ever written about it — the evening of 2 September — correctly called the
lapse an expected overnight state. No report came after that, because
reports come from sessions and there were no sessions. Nothing was lost;
Oracle rose. The blindness is the defect.

**What was actually true at the broker, checked 2026-09-12 (read-only):**
position ORCL 5.3089 @ $146.27 average, one open stop-limit SELL for 5.0
(stop $137.53, limit $133.40) submitted 2026-09-02 18:32:47 UTC. Nothing
else open.

**The real cause, from the desk's own log, not inferred.** At 18:32:47 UTC
on 09-02 the entry protection logged the hybrid split — "GTC over 5 whole
share(s) + DAY over 0.3089 sub-share remainder" — and BOTH legs landed
("[GTC whole-share] ... qty=5.0000", "[DAY fractional] ... qty=0.3089").
At 00:00:42 UTC on 09-03 the evening run's coverage sweep logged
"FRACTIONAL DAY STOP LAPSED (expected)" and put `unprotected_value: 45.18`
in its result. The six trading-mode timers last fired at 13:00 UTC on
09-03 — before the 09:30 ET open — and have not fired since (the daily
P&L export and the alert heartbeat kept running). So: not an `int()`,
not a floor bug, not a silent retry at a smaller size. `_split_protective_qty`
did exactly what spec §11.1 says. The design's precondition — "re-placed
by the next session's coverage sweep" — was simply false for nine days,
and no code checked the precondition.

**What the broker permits, and how we know.** Fractional orders must be
DAY; a fractional GTC is refused outright (code 42210000, "fractional
orders must be DAY orders"); fractional trailing stops are refused at any
tif; STOP/DAY, STOP_LIMIT/DAY and LIMIT/DAY are accepted. Source: the
repo's own probe against the live paper account on 2026-09-01 (recorded in
`src/execution/broker.py`, `config/settings.yaml` and the owner's notes),
cross-checked today against Alpaca's published fractional-trading page,
which says the same: market, limit, stop and stop-limit "with a time in
force = Day", no other tif. I did not re-probe live — the brief was
read-only and the measurement is eleven days old with a documented error
code. Conclusion: **a 5.3089-share stop CAN be placed, as a DAY order, and
it dies at 16:00 ET; there is no order the broker will hold overnight on a
fractional quantity.** This is a platform limit, not a bug we own.

**What was ruled out.** (1) A flooring bug — the 5.0 is the deliberate GTC
leg, and the DAY leg was placed. (2) A broker rejection retried smaller —
both legs were accepted on the first attempt; the log shows no retry. (3)
The cockpit misreporting — the API's positions/orders match the log
exactly. (4) "It's under one share so it's negligible" — already found
wrong on 2026-09-02 and stays wrong: a sub-one-share position lapses in
full, and a gap moves the whole slice.

**What shipped.** `src/coverage_watchdog.py`, called from
`scripts/alert_heartbeat.py` after its channel probe. That unit fires at
06:15 ET seven days a week regardless of the trading timers — the one thing
proven to still run while the desk is paused, which is exactly when this
matters. It reads positions and open stops from the broker, and session
evidence from `alert_channel_checks` (the same rows the silence watchdog
reads), and sends one owner alert — with the dollar amount — when (a)
coverage is short of held and (b) no scheduled session completed during
the most recent trading session's cash hours. (b) is the design's own
precondition stated as a test, so no number was introduced; the
session-hours window is the existing `intra_check` window plus the silence
watchdog's existing timer-cadence slack. It re-alerts at most once per
trading day while the condition holds (item 41's existing ruling for a
persistent fault), never on a healthy morning (the owner ratified that a
nightly lapse must not page), and it never places, changes or cancels an
order. The heartbeat's own exit code is untouched — it still means only
"can the desk reach the owner". Tests reproduce the real ORCL state and
assert the healthy morning stays silent.

**What did NOT ship, on purpose.** No workaround for the broker limit. A
"stop for the remainder that survives the close" cannot be built; anything
that looked like one would be a lie in the order book. The remainder is an
owner decision — WORK.md item 53 / BOARD_NOTES 53: close it while paused,
accept it with the alert, or go whole-share (declined 2026-09-02).

**Found in passing, NOT fixed (pre-existing).** The desk-wide silence
watchdog (item 17c) ships a systemd timer under `scripts/systemd/` but that
timer is not installed on the box: it is absent from the qamc timer list
and its state file has never been written. So the alarm built to fire on
"no session ran" has never run in production — which is also why nine
days of silence produced no message. Installing units on the box is an
operator action outside a PR; flagged for the owner.

**What would catch it next time.** The watchdog above, by construction.
And the general shape to remember: any protection whose design says
"re-placed by the next run" needs a check that lives OUTSIDE the runs.

### 2026-09-12 — funnel item 6 ("no structural level to derive a target from") retired: the refusal cannot fire any more, and the question it asked no longer exists

**In plain words:** the census once counted 3 of 68 trade ideas (all on
2026-09-02) thrown away because the desk could not find a chart level above
the entry to aim a profit target at. The board flagged it "too new to
classify" and asked for a re-measure. There is nothing left to re-measure:
the desk no longer sets profit targets at all, so "no level to derive a
target from" is not a reason to refuse anything, and the code path that
produced that refusal was made unreachable on 2026-09-11.

**Why it is dead twice over.**

1. *The refusal cannot fire.* The level engine's "no level in the trade's
   direction" refusal used to require the analyst to ALSO label the setup a
   breakout before it would project a measured-move reference instead of
   refusing. On 2026-09-11 the shared trend-trade definition
   (`src/risk/constants.py::is_trend_trade`) was given the measured fact —
   the desk's own level computation found no ceiling — and with that fact
   supplied the condition is always true, so the branch returns a
   projection every time. The refusal constant is kept only because it
   appears in historical logs and in the census; the level engine's own
   comment names this item and says so.
2. *The premise is gone.* Since the owner decision of 2026-09-11 (docs/WORK.md
   item 1(d)) profit-taking is the trailing stop and nothing else. A
   breakout is never judged on reward:risk; a range trade's real ratio is a
   ranking input and a starter-size cap, not a gate. A target is now a
   reference number for ranking and the Risk Manager's display, never a
   price the desk exits at, so failing to derive one is not a reason a
   trade should not happen.

**What was ruled out:** that the three 2026-09-02 cases were a regression
from that day's ship. They were the pre-2026-09-11 label-dependent refusal
working as it was then written, on charts whose own computed levels found
nothing overhead — exactly the case the projection now handles.

**What would catch it next time:** nothing needs to. The only genuine
"nothing can be read from this chart" case is still refused one branch
earlier (`REFUSAL_NO_STRUCTURE`), and that refusal is counted by the
silent-feed-outage watchdog (funnel item 11).

No source change. Documentation only: item 6 deleted from the board, its
plain-language block removed from `docs/BOARD_NOTES.md`, number retired.

### 2026-09-11 — the desk's loss alarms assumed the future would look like the past (and the first fix measured the wrong thing)

**In plain words:** the desk had three alarms that say "we have lost too
much, stop taking risk" — one for a single day, one for a week, one for a
month. Each was set to a fixed percentage of the account: lose more than
6.7% in a day and the alarm goes off. The trouble with a fixed percentage
is that it is only the right number for the kind of market it was chosen
in. In a calm market 6.7% in one day is a catastrophe the alarm should
have caught much earlier; in a violent one it is an ordinary Tuesday and
the alarm shuts the desk down for no reason. The alarms now measure a loss
against how much **the things the desk is actually holding** normally move
in a day, worked out from those holdings' real market price history, and
that measurement is redone every day. Nothing about how big a position
gets was touched.

**Corrected the same day, and this is the more important half of the
entry.** The first version of this fix measured *the account's own
day-to-day movement* instead. The owner spotted why that was wrong before
it shipped. Two reasons, and no amount of tuning fixes either:

1. The account had just been reset and would spend its first couple of
   weeks moving money from cash into positions. An account sitting mostly
   in cash barely moves — so the "normal daily movement" it measured over
   exactly those weeks would have been far too small, the alarms would
   have been set far too tight, and they would then have gone off
   constantly once the money was actually invested.
2. This desk has never worked properly — that is the whole content of its
   defect list. Setting a safety limit from a record of malfunction is not
   sound, and waiting longer does not cure it.

Measuring the holdings instead has none of those problems and is better on
its own terms: it works from the first day (a share's price history is
years long no matter when we bought it), and it automatically allows less
loss when less money is invested, which is what it should do.

**The owner's objection, and why the obvious fix was refused.** The
previous round (2026-09-04, entry below) had already fixed two real bugs in
these numbers, and the remaining complaint was that the underlying
"anchor" had never been validated against real trading history. The
obvious next step was to recalibrate it from more history. **The owner
refused that**, and was right to: markets are not stationary, so a number
picked once — however carefully, and from however much history — is wrong
again as soon as conditions change. Recalibrating produces a *better*
frozen number with the *identical* structural flaw. The basis had to
change, not the calibration.

**What the new basis is.** Each alarm trips at
`sensitivity × (the held book's realized daily volatility) × √(window
length)`. The volatility is the sample standard deviation of the *current
portfolio's* daily returns over a rolling trailing 20 sessions —
reconstructed from the real market price history of the actual holdings at
their actual weights — recomputed every session. One measurement, one
definition, three alarms.

**Why the portfolio's returns are rebuilt first, rather than combining the
holdings' individual volatilities.** Combining them separately would
ignore how they move together: it would overstate the normal move of a
genuinely diversified book and understate a book that is really one bet
wearing four tickers. Weighting the daily returns and then taking the
standard deviation of the result handles correlation implicitly and
exactly, and needs no correlation estimate of its own.

**Weights are fractions of equity and are deliberately not rescaled to sum
to 1.** A book that is 30% invested therefore reconstructs a normal daily
move about 30% the size of the same basket fully invested, and its alarm
tightens to match. That is intended, not a rounding artefact: a third of
the book at risk should not be allowed the same loss as all of it.

**What is genuinely research-grounded here, and what is not. This
distinction is the point of the entry.**

- The **√time window relationship** is real, published, and already cited
  in this codebase: drawdown magnitude over a window scales with the
  square root of the window length (Van Hemert, Ganz, Harvey et al.,
  *Drawdowns*, Journal of Portfolio Management, 2020). Unchanged. It is
  now expressed ONCE, as a single sensitivity scaled by √T, instead of as
  three independently-stored per-window multiples — which is exactly the
  arrangement that allowed the 2026-09-04 "the daily breaker and the
  5-day brake share one multiple" bug to exist at all.
- Measuring risk **relative to recent realized volatility** is ordinary,
  standard risk-management practice, not an invention of this desk.
- The **trigger sensitivity is NOT importable.** Real research was done
  on 2026-09-11 specifically looking for a published convention for "N
  multiples of recent volatility trips a drawdown alarm", and there is
  none. Anyone presenting such a number as an industry standard has
  invented it. So it is shipped as an explicitly provisional value and
  labelled that way in `src/config.py`, `config/settings.yaml`,
  `docs/WORK.md` and the test module — not as a researched constant.

**How the sensitivity was set: 6.7 first, then 3.0 by owner decision.**
The first value, 6.7, was chosen purely for day-one continuity and
deliberately not as a severity opinion — it is the number that makes the
new thresholds equal the ones already live at a documented reference
volatility, so the only thing that would change on the day it landed is
that the thresholds now MOVE. The reference — ~1.0% per session — was
measured from real market data over this desk's own configured 101-symbol
universe: trailing-20-session realized daily volatility of equal-weight
baskets the size this desk actually runs came in at a median of 1.04% (5
names), 0.86% (8) and 0.80% (12), spread roughly 0.55%-1.7%. That proxy
measurement is exactly what the live mechanism now does for real, against
actual holdings and actual weights.

**Making that measurement is what exposed the problem with 6.7, and it is
worth recording as a finding in its own right.** Nobody had ever measured
what the inherited setting meant in practice. It means the daily circuit
breaker only fires on a **~6.7-standard-deviation session** — a
crash-grade event. The daily brake was, in effect, dormant, and had been
all along. That was not a property this change introduced; it was the
first actual measurement of how loose the inherited number always was, and
it says the breaker sat much further out than "3 losing max-size trades in
a day" ever sounded.

**The owner reviewed the measured numbers and set it to 3.0.** Roughly a
3% daily loss on a book whose normal session is ~1% — a genuinely rough
day rather than a crash. **This is a deliberate, reversible risk-appetite
decision and it is NOT a researched, derived or validated number.** It is
labelled provisional in `src/risk/constants.py`, `src/config.py`,
`config/settings.yaml`, `docs/WORK.md` and the test module. Do not let a
later pass present it as derived.

The thresholds it produces at a ~1%/session book, written down rather than
assumed: **-3.0% for one day, -6.7% over five days, -13.4% over twenty**
(previously -6.7%, -15.0%, -20.0%). These move with the real book; the
figures above are illustration of scale, not configuration.

**A consequence worth naming: at 3.0 the 20-day cap no longer binds.** The
20-day threshold is capped at the de-levering ladder's -20% owner-alert
point. At 6.7 that cap was active at any plausible volatility. At 3.0 it
only engages above roughly 1.5%/session. It stays regardless, because it
is the thing that guarantees this brake can never be asleep past the point
the ladder halves the book and alerts the owner, whatever the regime.

**Why the sensitivity is not, and cannot be, calibrated from the account's
own record.** That was attempted first and is precisely what the owner
rejected. The live desk's `daily_pnl` table was read directly on
2026-09-11 and holds **exactly one row** — 2026-09-02, the reset day — but
the deeper point is that even a full record would not do: it would be a
record of malfunction, contaminated by the ramp from cash and by the open
defect backlog. The architecture is fixed and no longer waits on the
account for anything. The sensitivity remains a risk-appetite dial, to be
revisited on the owner's appetite or on evidence from live operation that
3.0 fires on days that turn out to be ordinary — not by fitting.

**Three bugs found and fixed while building this, all real.**

- **A violent session was widening its own alarm.** With the volatility
  window including the session being judged, a -6% day on a book that
  normally moves 0.25% raises the measured volatility enough to
  re-classify itself as ordinary — the alarm becomes unable to fire on
  precisely the days it exists for. The window now ends at the previous
  session: the question is "is today abnormal against what came before
  it".
- **In a violent regime the DAILY limit could go deeper than the 20-day
  brake.** Only the 20-day window was capped at the de-levering ladder's
  -20% owner-alert point, so at high volatility the one-day limit computed
  to -34% — a shorter window tolerating a bigger loss than a longer one.
  All three are capped at the ladder alert now, and the 5-day threshold is
  additionally clamped to the 20-day one, so
  `|1-day| ≤ |5-day| ≤ |20-day| ≤ 20%` always holds.
- **A perfectly offsetting book produced an alarm threshold of almost
  zero.** Found by test after the switch to holdings-based measurement. A
  long and a short that cancel exactly measure not 0 but ~2e-15% per
  session — floating-point residue — which sailed past a plain
  "is the volatility zero?" check and would have set a threshold of
  effectively 0%, tripping the alarm on the first cent lost. The check is
  now against a noise floor *derived* from double-precision arithmetic on
  the input prices (about 1e-14%/session), not a picked number, so it can
  only ever reject arithmetic noise.

**A trap that would have made the whole change inert, worth recording.**
`config/settings.yaml` carried `max_daily_loss_pct: 6.7`. That field is an
override that beats every derivation, so production would have stayed on a
fixed percentage forever while every unit test passed. It is now `null`,
with the reason written above it, and a test asserts it stays null.

**What was deliberately NOT done.** Position sizing was not touched, and
no volatility-targeting exposure scaling was added. That technique was
investigated and rejected for this desk separately (it imports a fund's
portfolio-smoothness goal, which is not this desk's survival goal — see
`docs/OUTCOME.md`). Volatility here is only the yardstick the ALARM
measures a loss against. A test asserts no sizing-shaped output leaks out
of the drawdown-alarm path.

**Behaviour today.** The alarms are live from the first session the desk
holds anything, because the measurement no longer waits on the account.
The fixed percentages survive only as the fallback for cases where there
is genuinely nothing to measure, each tested: an entirely cash book (there
is no portfolio to measure — treating it as "zero volatility" would trip
the alarm on the first cent lost); a holding with no usable price history
when it is the only holding; and any failure of the broker or market-data
read. A holding with no usable history *alongside* measurable ones is
dropped from the estimate and named in the logs rather than voiding it —
that makes the measured volatility a lower bound, so the threshold comes
out tighter and the alarm fires sooner rather than later, which is the safe
direction for a brake and is arithmetically the same as that holding not
being invested.

**One residual behaviour, recorded rather than guarded.** A book held
entirely in a cash-equivalent sweep vehicle has a real but tiny normal
daily move, so it would get a correspondingly tiny threshold. No floor was
invented to prevent that: a loss much larger than such a book's normal
move genuinely is anomalous, and picking a minimum threshold would have
meant inventing a number. Worth revisiting if the desk ever parks the
whole book in a sweep vehicle with the brakes live.

**What would catch a regression:**
`tests/test_drawdown_vol_relative_brake.py` proves the measurement reports
what the held book is actually doing; that a less-invested book gets a
proportionally tighter threshold; that two holdings moving together are
priced as one bet and an offsetting pair is not the sum of its parts; that
a leveraged ETF's weight is not multiplied by its leverage a second time
(its own price series already carries it); that the measurement's own
signature cannot reach the account's performance record; that returns are
keyed on dates rather than list position; that the same absolute loss trips
the alarm on a calm book and not on a volatile one; that doubling measured
volatility doubles the alarm distance; that the √time relation and the
severity ordering hold at every volatility tested; that a violent session
cannot widen its own threshold; that an all-cash book, a holding with no
price history, a single-position book, junk bars, a broken market feed and
a broken broker read all fall back to the fixed percentage rather than
disabling the breaker; that the shipped sensitivity is 3.0 and the
thresholds it produces are what is written above; and that `settings.yaml`
does not pin the breaker back to a literal.
`tests/test_drawdown_brake_rescale.py` still pins the fallback numbers
unchanged.

### 2026-09-11 — a rule allowing one stock to be the whole account rested on a fact that had already stopped being true

**In plain words:** a rule let a single stock be sized up to 100% of the
account. The note explaining why said it was safe because the account
could not borrow money to buy more than it held in cash. Borrowing had
been switched on two days *before* that note was written. Nobody
noticed, and the note stood for a week describing a safety net that no
longer existed.

Why it mattered: every other safety number on this desk assumes the
stop-loss sell order actually fires. That is a fair assumption for a
stock that drifts down. It does nothing for a stock that gaps — opens
60% lower on a Monday, or stops trading entirely because a fraud was
discovered overnight. The stop never gets a chance to fire. The single-name
cap was the only thing left limiting the damage in that case, and it had
quietly stopped doing its job.

**First pass: a derived number, not a guessed one.** Real industry
practice was checked first. No stated "this is the standard notional
concentration limit" number exists for a desk like this — the closest
real regulation (a broker-capital rule) only establishes that
concentration is a recognized risk, not what the limit should be. So the
number was derived instead from this desk's own already-ratified
parameters: a single stock's worst realistic one-day disaster should not,
by itself, reach the point where the desk's own -20% ladder already
declares an emergency and alerts the owner. Using the median of five real,
dated single-session collapses in liquid, well-covered stocks (Luckin
Coffee -75%, Wirecard -62%, Silicon Valley Bank -60%, Kraft Heinz -28%,
ADM -24% — none penny stocks), that arithmetic gives 33%.

**Second pass, same day: the owner reviewed the derivation and set his own
number instead.** Not a data disagreement — a risk-appetite one. He
rejected 33% as too conservative for a desk that does not trade
penny/micro-cap names. Corrected directly: avoiding penny stocks does not
remove this failure mode, since all five reference disasters above were
liquid, well-covered companies, not cheap stock. That correction was on
the table before he chose the number, not after. He set **65%.**

**What 65% actually costs, stated plainly rather than glossed over.** At
65%, the same median disaster (-60%) now costs about 39% of the account —
past the desk's own emergency line, not under it, the way 33% guaranteed.
Only the mildest of the five reference events stays under that line at
65%. In exchange, 65% barely binds on ordinary trades at this desk's real
stop distances — unlike 33%, which would have shrunk high-conviction
trades to roughly two-thirds of what was requested. This is a knowing
trade-off, not an oversight, and it is written into the code comment
exactly this way so it cannot be mistaken for a derived number later.

**What would catch a regression:** `tests/test_risk_based_sizing.py`
pins the deployed ceiling at 65, checks it against the shipped setting,
and checks it against the portfolio-wide net exposure cap so the two
never get confused for one another. `tests/test_prompts_anchors.py`
pins the number inside the PM's own prompt so a prompt edit cannot drift
from the code silently.

### 2026-09-04 — the minimum stop distance was a number nobody derived, and it was closing the funnel

**In plain words:** every trade had to put its stop-loss at least three
average daily moves away from the entry price. Nobody ever worked out why
three. It turned out to be so far away that almost no trade could pass the
desk's own "is the reward worth the risk" test afterwards — for the kind of
setup this desk trades most, literally none could. It is now 1.5, and that
number comes from measuring how far the desk's own winning trades actually
dipped before they worked.

**What the symptom looked like.** Signals kept dying on reward:risk rather
than on judgement. The 2026-09-01 morning run is the clearest instance: 38
qualified signals, 30 of them under the 1.5 reward:risk floor before anyone
assessed the trade, zero trades placed. The floor was the obvious suspect
and it was the wrong one.

**What the cause actually was.** Reward:risk is `(target - entry) /
(entry - stop)`. The floor was being judged against a stop the desk had
FABRICATED — `risk.min_stop_atr_multiple` pushed the analyst's stop out to
3.0x ATR (scaled 1.15x for a range setup = 3.45x) whenever structure had
placed it nearer. That inflates the denominator, and the arithmetic is
unforgiving: a stop `k` ATRs out with a target projected `ATR * sqrt(H)`
away clears a floor `f` only when `sqrt(H) >= f*k`. At k = 3.45 and f = 1.5
that is a stated horizon of ~27 sessions. **This desk has never stated a
27-session horizon.** The gate was not strict; for range setups it was
arithmetically unsatisfiable.

**Where the 3.0 came from: nowhere.** Traced back through the comments, the
reasoning jumps from a MEASURED figure (1.25x ATR, "one ordinary day's
range", which is real and still used by the exit noise band) to a CHOSEN 3.0
with nothing cited in between. It has never been validated against an
outcome.

**Ruled out before changing it.** Lowering `min_reward_risk_after_widening`
was considered and rejected — the floor was never the defect, and lowering
the bar to fit a bad denominator is how a desk talks itself into worse
trades. Published trading doctrine was checked directly and does put stops
in a 2-3x ATR band, which is presumably where 3.0 was absorbed from, but
that band is for a TRAILING stop that moves up as a trade becomes
profitable. Combining it with a fixed reward:risk floor measured at ENTRY —
which is what this desk does — does not appear in the literature at all, and
is self-defeating on inspection: a 3x stop needs a 4.5x target to clear a
1.5 floor, which is not a realistic move to claim.

**How 1.5 was derived.** Maximum Adverse Excursion analysis (John Sweeney's
method) on this desk's own real trade signals. MAE asks the only question
that sets an entry stop honestly: how far did trades that EVENTUALLY WON dip
against entry before they worked? A stop belongs outside that distance, and
no further — every additional ATR of room is paid for twice, once in a
smaller position for the same dollar risk and once in a worse reward:risk
ratio.

- Worst adverse excursion among all real winners in the sample: **1.84x ATR**.
- A **1.5x ATR** floor would have stopped out about **1% of real winners**.
- Because `shares = risk_usd / |entry - stop|`, halving the stop distance
  roughly doubles the position for the same risk, which roughly **triples**
  the reward:risk arithmetic on the same target.

1.5 is also bracketed by the one independently measured number this codebase
already owned: it sits ABOVE the 1.25x ATR noise band and BELOW the 1.84x
worst-winner excursion. Both ends are measurements, not preferences.

**A second, separate defect found in the same place: the setup scalers were
backwards.** Range setups were given the WIDEST floor (x1.15) and breakouts
the tightest (x0.85). That is inverted on both doctrine and data. A range
trade is a mean-reversion structure inside a defined band — the
LOWER-volatility setup, invalidating at the band edge — and it is this
desk's majority setup and the one the wide floor closed outright. A breakout
enters on volatility EXPANSION, and its ATR reading is computed over the
quiet consolidation that preceded the break, so ATR systematically
understates the range a breakout is about to see. Corrected to **breakout
x1.00, range x0.90**.

**How confident to be in each half, stated separately because they are not
equal.** The 1.5 base is well grounded. The scaler magnitudes are a
secondary, less-verified layer — there is no per-setup-type MAE breakdown to
size them from. So they were derived from constraints rather than chosen:

- **Breakout 1.00** — no measurement supports a specific widening, so the
  inversion was corrected by REMOVING the unearned 0.85 discount rather than
  by inventing a number. Breakouts run at the base.
- **Range 0.90** — the tightest scaler that keeps the NARROWEST reachable
  stop outside the measured noise band. Worst case is a range setup on a
  risk-on tape: `1.5 x 0.90 x 0.95 = 1.2825` ATR, still outside 1.25. The
  obvious 0.85 was rejected for exactly this reason: `1.5 x 0.85 x 0.95 =
  1.2113` puts the stop back INSIDE the measured noise band, which is the
  original defect reintroduced from the other side.

Net: every reachable floor now lies in **1.28-1.80 ATR** — above the
measured noise band, below the worst real winner's drawdown.

**What did NOT change.** `min_reward_risk_after_widening` is still 1.5 — the
payoff bar did not move, only the stop the ratio is divided by.
`absolute_min_stop_atr_multiple` is still 1.0; it is a SEPARATE, tighter
backstop under the level-backed exemption and was never conflated with this.
The 1x ATR guard in `config/prompts/tech_analyst.md` still prevents a noise
stop upstream.

**One real consequence worth knowing about before it gets rediscovered as a
new bug.** Halving stop distances roughly doubles the notional a full
5%-risk trade wants: at this desk's median 2.56%-of-price ATR a floored stop
is now ~3.5% rather than ~5-9%, and `notional = risk / stop` then wants
~143% of equity. The 100% single-name cap therefore binds again on
tight-stop names and delivers ~3.5% risk instead of 5%. That is not a
regression from this change — `allow_margin: false` makes anything past 100%
of equity in one name physically unreachable whatever any cap says. Whether
to enable margin is an owner decision and was not taken here.

**Honest limits on the evidence.** The MAE sample is this desk's own short
history: roughly two weeks, no risk-off regime in it, and no post-fix
realised stop-out data — the 2026-09-02 clean-slate reset removed the older
equity curve. 1.5 is far better grounded than the 3.0 it replaces; it is not
a permanent constant. **Re-measure once real post-fix trade history exists.**

**What would catch this next time.** The failure was not that 3.0 was wrong;
it was that a number with no derivation sat in the config for months and no
check ever asked it to justify itself. The specific tell was available the
whole time and was visible in the comments: a stated chain of reasoning that
moves from a measured figure to a chosen one without an intervening step.
Reading config comments for THAT shape — rather than for whether the number
looks sensible — is what found it.


### 2026-09-04 — item 25: a sell whose stated reason is provably untrue now actually gets stopped, and the owner is told

**In plain words:** the desk already had a check that could catch the AI
saying something untrue to justify selling a position it should be holding —
claiming the market turned risk-off today when the recorded macro reading
says it did not, or claiming fresh bad news on the stock when the recorded
news for today says the opposite. Until now that check only wrote a note in
the log. The trade went through anyway. It now stops the trade, and sends a
Telegram message saying which position, what was claimed, and why it was
found untrue. The owner approved this change so the desk can also start
measuring how often it actually happens.

**The one distinction the whole change rests on.** "We proved this claim
false" and "we could not check this claim" are different answers and must
never be collapsed into one. Only the first blocks anything.

- *Proven false* — the reasoning asserts a checkable fact and the desk's own
  recorded data for TODAY says the opposite: a claimed risk-off flip against
  a trusted macro read showing a different regime; a claimed high-conviction
  bearish news event against a same-day news row that names the symbol with
  a non-bearish direction. Blocks the decision, alerts the owner.
- *Unverifiable* — the claim was made but the data needed to judge it is not
  there this run: the macro seat failed or was untrusted, or no same-day news
  row names the symbol at all. Logged exactly as before, never blocked, never
  alerted. The news pipeline can simply not have written a real catalyst up
  as a formal row yet, so treating "not found" as "false" would manufacture
  vetoes against honest exits — which would be a worse bug than the gap being
  closed.
- The third allowed exit trigger, the trade's own `thesis_invalid_if`, is
  still never evaluated here at all, so a sell resting on it is untouched.

Before this, the code had no name for the middle case: an unverifiable claim
and a confirmed claim both simply returned nothing. Adding the veto forced
the three-way split to be made explicit, which is most of the change.

**What was deliberately NOT changed:** the bar for reaching "false". The
claim-detection is still phrase matching over free text with a short
negation-cue guard, and the reason that used to be given for keeping this
check toothless is now the reason the FALSE bar stays exactly where it is.
The known residual risk is accepted with eyes open and was the owner's call:
a correctly-read false claim about the macro or news trigger does not by
itself prove the sell is wrong, because an unverifiable `thesis_invalid_if`
might independently justify it. The Risk Manager can re-propose the exit next
cycle citing something true. The alert exists so the frequency of that
trade-off gets measured rather than assumed — and, like the data-quality
alert, it is deliberately not deduplicated, because suppressing repeats would
destroy the count that is the point of it.

**What would catch a regression:** `tests/test_holding_discipline_block.py`
pins all three verdicts at the unit level and end to end through the risk
stage — proven-false blocks and alerts once; unverifiable is logged with no
alert and the decision survives; a true claim produces no event at all. It
also pins that an alerting failure cannot break the trading path, and that
blocking the last surviving leg ends the run through the same terminal
"rejected" status a per-symbol Risk Manager refusal already used. The veto
reuses that existing refusal mechanism rather than adding a second one.

### 2026-09-04 — three independent exit-management defects fixed in one PR

**In plain words:** a real-data audit of tonight's exit and ranking
behaviour found three separate problems. They live in related files and
shipped together, but each is its own bug with its own cause and its own
standard fix — none of them is a personal risk-preference question, so each
was fixed against established professional practice rather than invented or
held for individual sign-off, per explicit owner instruction. Read as three
fixes, not one change.

**Fix 1 — the "is this move noise" exit veto was flat, so it choked off
exits on older positions.** The Position Reviewer's guard against exiting on
an ordinary day's price wobble (`src/risk/exit_guard.py::adverse_move_is_
noise`) compared the adverse move to a FLAT 1.0xATR band no matter how long
the position had been held. Measured against 12 real positions opened
before item 22's stop-floor fix: on 8 of those 12, that flat band came out
about the same width as the entry stop itself (0.89-1.12 ATR), so almost
every attempted early, deliberate exit was blocked — 5 of 9 real exits ended
up as plain broker stop-outs instead. This codebase already trusts
sqrt(time) scaling for the mirror-image question (how far a target should
be projected, in `src/data/levels.py`), on the standard statistical basis
that expected price dispersion grows with the square root of elapsed time,
not linearly. The noise band now uses the same scaling and the same
constant convention: `1.0xATR * sqrt(days_held)`, floored at one session so
a brand-new position sees no change at all. `src/pipeline.py`'s executor was
updated to pass the position's actual `days_held` through; before, the
noise-band call site did not have (and did not need) that number at all.

**Fix 2 — ranking ties broke alphabetically, a real and undisclosed bias.**
Item 18's own audit (see "2026-09-03 — Phase 13, first increment" below)
already named this as a stated but meaningless rule; this pass measured how
often it actually fires on real days (9 of 12 eligible names tied one day,
23 of 33 another) — common enough that "tied, so alphabetical" was
effectively deciding which stock got picked on most trading days. Every
early-alphabet ticker was getting a permanent, free edge that had nothing to
do with the quality of the call. Fixed in `src/verdicts.py::rank_verdicts`:
before falling back to the ticker symbol, ties now break on `risk_reward` —
the reward-to-risk ratio each seat already computes and attaches as
evidence for its own call (`VerdictEvidence(label="risk_reward", ...)`).
That is real, already-available information about which candidate is
actually better supported, at no new cost. Symbol is still the very last
tiebreaker, reached only once two candidates are equal on every real signal
this module has — at that point nothing distinguishes them anyway, so a
fixed, reproducible order is a housekeeping need, not a bias.

**Fix 3 — a "range"-type trade got zero profit protection until it hit
100% of its target.** `src/risk/trailing.py`'s Type A (range) management —
this desk's most common setup by real observed frequency — never moved the
stop at all until price exceeded the full target. A trade could travel 90%
or more of the way to its goal and give back every cent of it, with nothing
in place the whole time; the audit flagged this as the single largest
un-backtested, asymmetric-downside rule found in the whole exit-management
review. Standard practice, cited across professional trading literature
(Van Tharp's R-multiple framework, Elder's Triple Screen), is to move the
stop to breakeven once a trade has locked in a defensible fraction of its
planned move — conventionally +1R, one initial-risk-unit of profit. That is
now implemented as an additive ratchet: once a range position reaches its
entry stop's original risk distance in profit, and the stop has not already
reached breakeven or better, the stop moves to breakeven. The existing rule
— no *structural* trailing (following swing lows/highs) until the target is
actually exceeded — is unchanged, and Type B (breakout) trailing, which
already rides the position from entry, was not touched.

**What would catch a regression.** `tests/test_phase3_exit_rework.py`
(noise-band sqrt-time scaling, including a same-move/different-days-held
comparison and an executor-level end-to-end case); `tests/test_analyst_
verdict.py` (a real tied-score pair resolved by risk_reward instead of the
alphabet, a no-evidence case that never crashes or wins undeservedly, and
the real production fixture's order re-pinned to the new, non-alphabetical
result); `tests/test_trailing_stops.py` (a range position ratcheting to
breakeven at +1R, staying there through a hard retrace that would have given
back the full original risk under the old logic, the short-side mirror, and
backward compatibility for every call site that does not yet pass the new
`initial_stop` argument).

---

### 2026-09-04 — a refusal to open a position and a real order to close it were the same number

**In plain words:** the desk's sizing math used the number **0%** to mean
three different things: "don't open this," "close what's already held," and
"open the opposite position." A refusal to buy something and a decision to
sell an existing position looked identical to the code that turns targets
into orders. That code defaulted to reading a zero as "close" — so a rule
that said "no" to a new trade could, in principle, have silently sold a real
position nobody asked to sell. It never actually happened (no trade log shows
it), but the trap was real and structural, not a one-off bug. This closes
item 13 in `docs/WORK.md`.

**How it was caught:** raised verbally by the owner, lost once to a context
compaction, then written down permanently in `docs/WORK.md` item 13 so it
could not be lost again. A partial workaround already existed: the
2026-09-02 "signed-dissent" change, when it decided a name's evidence didn't
support opening a position, deleted that name from its internal list rather
than sizing it at a literal zero — which avoided the trap for that one code
path, but only because that one path remembered to special-case it. Nothing
stopped a different rule, written later, from forgetting.

**The fix.** Borrowed, not invented: `pysystemtrade` (Rob Carver's
open-source systematic trading framework) solves exactly this with what it
calls an override algebra. Instead of a plain number, a sizing decision is
one of four distinct kinds — "don't trade," "close it," "only allow
shrinking," or "trade this amount" — and there is a fixed rule for combining
two of them: the more cautious one always wins. "Don't trade" can never be
watered back down into "trade a little" by combining it with something else,
the way `min(0, 5)` is still just the number zero with no memory of where it
came from.

`src/risk/size_override.py` implements this as a small type,
`SizeOverride`, with that same ordering (`no_trading > close > reduce_only >
multiplier`) and a `combine()` method enforcing it. The important design
choice: asking a "don't trade" value for its size is now a hard error, not a
0.0 you can accidentally treat as a real number. That is what makes the old
bug impossible to write by accident rather than merely unlikely.

**What was migrated.** The one real caller that had the bug and worked
around it — `PortfolioConstructor._plan_risk_targets`, the place that
combines the PM's risk envelope with the agreement-ceiling check from the
2026-09-02 dissent rule — now builds `SizeOverride` values for both caps and
combines them instead of taking a raw `min()` of two floats and checking
`<= 0.0`. When the result is a refusal, the target is still dropped from the
order-construction list exactly as before (so a refused BUY still leaves any
held position untouched) — but now because the type says so, not because
this one function remembered to check for it.

**What was deliberately not touched.** `TargetPosition.risk_allocation_pct
== 0.0` (the PM's own explicit "close this" instruction) was left as a plain
float. That zero is not ambiguous — it is the one legitimate, sourced case
where 0% really does mean "close," authored directly by the Portfolio
Manager, and it already routes through its own code path
(`PortfolioConstructor._plan_risk_targets`'s `closes` set) before the
envelope/agreement-ceiling logic ever runs. Converting it to `SizeOverride`
as well would have been a larger, purely stylistic change with no bug behind
it, so it was left alone. Every other place a target's weight is combined
with a real refusal — the code in `_plan_risk_targets` this incident is
about — was migrated; no ambiguous-zero call site was knowingly left
half-fixed.

**Verification:** `tests/test_size_override.py` (new) proves the combination
rule for every pairwise combination of the four kinds, proves "don't trade"
wins no matter what it's combined with (including an arbitrarily large
trade size), and proves the old bug can no longer be expressed — reading a
size off a "don't trade" or "close" value raises instead of returning a
number. The existing agreement-ceiling tests
(`tests/test_agreement_sizing.py`, `tests/test_signed_dissent.py`,
`tests/test_portfolio_constructor.py`) all pass unchanged, confirming the
migration is a pure refactor of the 2026-09-02 workaround with no behaviour
change for real sessions.

### 2026-09-04 — insider cluster window was 7x wider than the research it was supposedly built on

**In plain words:** the code that decides whether several insiders buying or
selling around the same time counts as a "cluster" (a stronger signal than
one person trading alone) used a 14-day window. The desk's own research
notes cite a real published paper for exactly this feature, and that paper
defines a cluster as trades within about 2 days — not 14. There was no
comment or rationale anywhere explaining the wider number; git blame traces
it to the feature's original commit (2026-08-25), before the research
citation was even written down (2026-08-27), so it was carried over from an
unrelated constant (`lookback_days`), not a deliberate choice.

**What was checked before changing it:** whether congressional-trade
disclosure lag (which is genuinely slower than SEC Form 4 insider filing
lag) could justify a wider window specifically for congressional data. It
does not apply — this provider only ever ingests SEC Form 4 insider filings;
there is no congressional-trading data source in this codebase to which a
different lag would apply.

**What was verified with real, fresh data, not just theory:** pulled 332
live Form 4 observations from SEC EDGAR (5 days, market-wide, the desk's own
production code path) and re-ran the real clustering logic at both the old
14-day and the corrected 2-day window. Result: identical — every real
multi-owner cluster found in the live sample had its owners trading within 2
days of each other anyway; the maximum spread across all 36 clustered
symbol/direction groups was 2 days. The wider window was not just
undocumented, it was contributing zero real clusters beyond what 2 days
already caught. Separately confirmed that a single insider's trade is never
discarded for failing to cluster — clustering only rescues transactions that
are below the individual dollar threshold on their own; of 40 real
observations that passed every gate in the sample, only one needed the
cluster rescue at all, and it survived under both window sizes.

**Fix:** `cluster_window_days` corrected from 14 to 2 in
`src/data/smart_money.py`, `src/config.py`, and `config/settings.yaml`,
with a comment citing the source. See `docs/WORK.md` item 32.

**Not fixed here, flagged as a separate question:** the same cited paper
says a sell should be judged by size relative to the insider's own
holdings, not an absolute dollar amount, and QAMC's filter is currently a
flat dollar threshold. This is a real, larger gap — but fixing it needs
insider holdings-size data the desk does not currently fetch, which is a
bigger design question than this fix's scope. Left for an owner decision.

---

### 2026-09-04 — the desk's own eligibility check and its own order-builder disagreed on which trades were even worth considering

**In plain words:** on 2026-09-01 the desk decided that its real reward-to-
risk number — the one that decides whether a trade is worth the risk — must
be computed from the real chart, not taken from whatever number the AI
analyst claims. That fix landed in the step that BUILDS the order, but never
in the EARLIER step that decides which candidates are even allowed to reach
the order-builder. So the desk had two different opinions about the same
number, at two different points in the same pipeline, and the earlier,
wrong one decided what the later, correct one ever got to see. Measured on a
real day: the early gate let through 8 names, the order-builder's real gate
would have let through 2 different names — none of them the same 8.

**What was broken:** `PortfolioManagerAgent.candidate_eligibility` and
`_apply_subfloor_catalyst_rule` (`src/agents/portfolio_manager.py`) read
`TechAnalysisResult.risk_reward` — real Python arithmetic, but computed
over the AI analyst's own entry price and its own GUESSED target, never
checked against the chart. `PortfolioConstructor` (the step that turns a
decision into an actual order) had already stopped trusting that number on
2026-09-01: it derives the take-profit from real support/resistance levels
and widens a too-tight stop to a real noise floor, then computes
reward:risk from THAT. The PM's gate runs first and decides which names the
model even gets to consider; the constructor's real answer runs later and
never gets a say over a name the PM already screened out — or a chance to
correctly admit a name the PM already screened out for looking bad on paper
when the real chart said otherwise.

**What was ruled out.** Not a new bug in the constructor's arithmetic — that
was already fixed and correct on its own terms. Not a config or a threshold
disagreement — both gates use the identical 1.5 floor
(`risk.min_reward_risk_after_widening`), confirmed by reading the value each
one is threaded. The only disagreement was WHICH input feeds that same
arithmetic.

**The fix.** `PortfolioConstructor.real_reward_risk_preview` (new method)
runs the constructor's own `_derive_target` / `_widen_stop_past_noise`
logic — not a second copy of it — against the analyst's snapshot entry and
stated stop (the live price and any PM-suggested stop do not exist yet this
early). `src/pipeline_stages.py` computes one of these per analysed
candidate, using the pipeline's already-configured `PortfolioConstructor`,
and passes the resulting map into `PortfolioManagerAgent.decide()` as
`real_reward_risk_by_symbol`; both eligibility gates now key off that map
instead of the self-reported field. A symbol the map cannot resolve a
number for is treated as sub-floor — fail closed, the same posture this
gate has always taken for an unmeasurable ratio.

**Re-measured, not just asserted fixed.** `ops/model_policy/
deterministic_selection.py`'s `evaluate()` gained the same real number as an
informational `rr_real` column, but its own gate was deliberately left
reading the self-reported figure: its one frozen fixture
(`run_64290730_pm_input.json`, 2026-09-01) predates
`TechAnalysisResult.computed_levels` being populated at all — every row's
list is empty — so the real derivation refuses every single name on that
fixture for lack of chart structure to derive from, which is a fact about
the fixture's age, not a finding about the rule. Switching that script's
gate would have silently replaced "the desk's own stated rules" with "no
data," corrupting the item-18 numbers this file and `docs/WORK.md` already
record, rather than correcting them.

The only real production data on hand with `computed_levels` populated
(the field this fix depends on) is 2026-09-02 — every earlier day in the
read-only snapshot available for this work predates that field being
emitted. Replayed both ways, hand-verified: one full morning session (34
actionable names: 8 eligible on the old self-reported gate, 0 on the new
real gate) and fourteen intraday re-checks that same day (49 more
actionable name-instances: 22 eligible old, 0 new). Zero overlap both
times — the audit's finding reproduces on a second, independent day, not
just the one fixture that first surfaced it.

**A second, more important finding fell out of the same measurement.** Real
eligibility came back at ZERO on the only day this could be checked against
real data — not "different names," genuinely none. Every candidate's own
stated stop was tighter than `min_stop_atr_multiple`'s required noise band,
so every stop gets widened before the reward:risk check runs; after
widening, the ratio essentially never clears 1.5. The tight-stop exemption
(a stop resting on a real, verified chart level is honoured however tight)
never fired for any of them — not because it is broken, but because the
touch-count field it checks (`computed_level_touches`, shipped 2026-09-03)
postdates every real record available to check it against. **This closes
the two-gates mismatch; it does not touch the width of the floor itself,**
which is a separate, real risk-tolerance question already tracked as item 1
in `docs/WORK.md` and explicitly left to the owner there. Fresh data dated
after 2026-09-03 (so the touch-count field has a chance to actually
populate) would give the floor question a fairer second read.

**What would catch this next time.** New tests in `tests/
test_portfolio_constructor.py`, `tests/test_subfloor_catalyst_gate.py` and
`tests/test_analyst_verdict.py` pin both directions of the disagreement by
hand-computed example — a candidate the model overstates (high self-
reported ratio, poor real one) and one it understates (low self-reported
ratio, good real one) — and assert the fixed gate lands on the real answer
either way, not just the direction that happened to fail first.

### 2026-09-04 — acceptance test broken on main by deleted cost-circuit config keys

**In plain words:** a test that validates the rehearsal harness (offline
reproduction of past sessions) was misconfigured for the new cost-circuit
architecture. It tried to set two config keys that item 14's rewrite deleted.
The test failed at config load time before it could run, blocking a clean
full-suite baseline.

**What was broken:** `tests/test_rehearsal_reproduces_cost_ceiling.py` had two
test functions. The first one was valid; the second one tried to reproduce a
pre-fix failure mode by forcing old config (`reservation_min_history_samples`,
`session_reserved_exposure_limit_usd`) that no longer exists after item 14
replaced the per-call cost-reservation layer with a settled-cost cap plus a
call-count cap. The config validator correctly rejects these keys, so the test
errored before it could run.

**What was fixed:** the second test was deleted entirely (its purpose —
proving the old failure mode could still reproduce — is architecturally moot:
the old failure mode is gone and cannot be forced through config anymore). The
first test's docstring was updated to explain why the second test is no longer
applicable and what the new cost-circuit architecture is. A stale example in
`ops/rehearsal/run.py` (help text) was updated from the deleted key to a
valid one.

**Verification:** the first test syntax compiles and can be collected. The
config module's own validator tests for the deletion already pass. No other
references to the deleted keys exist in the codebase outside the docs.

---

### 2026-09-03 — the analyst's exit condition could get quietly cut off before anyone checked it

**In plain words:** when an analyst opens a position, they write down what
would prove them wrong — the specific condition that means "get out." That
condition was never given its own place to live. It was stuffed as extra
text onto the end of a longer explanation, and that longer explanation gets
shortened twice on its way through the system (once to 500 characters, once
again to 280). A long enough condition could get sliced off entirely before
a later check ever saw it — the exit trigger simply wasn't there to find.

**What was fixed:** the condition now gets its own dedicated place to live,
separate from the shortened explanation text, so it survives complete no
matter how long it is (capped generously at 2,000 characters only as a
guard against a runaway AI response, not as a real limit — a real condition
has never come close to that). It is carried through to the database and
into the desk's day-to-day memory of why each position was opened, so it is
still there in full after a restart, not just for the rest of the same run.
The old shortened text is untouched and still there for anything that
already reads it — nothing was removed, only something was added that
cannot be lost the same way.

**What this does NOT fix, and isn't meant to:** having the condition intact
is a precondition for actually checking it against real prices later — a
separate piece of work, in progress in parallel, not built here. This entry
only closes the "the condition itself can vanish" half of the gap.

**Verification:** real tests built a condition longer than both truncation
points (500 and 280 characters) and proved it survives completely intact on
a buy, a short, and a sell, while the old shortened text is confirmed
already cut down by the time anything could read it back out. A database
round-trip test and a legacy-row (no-value) test were also written. Each
test was proven real by breaking the fix, watching the exact test fail, and
restoring it. Full relevant suite: 395 passed, 0 failed, both before and
after.

### 2026-09-03 — checked "infeasible" against real data instead of accepting it: of 1,028 real recorded exit conditions, 1,022 turned out to be checkable

**In plain words:** when a position is bought, the analyst writes a plain-English
sentence for when the trade idea would be proven wrong — "closes below the
50-day average", "loses the $142 level". Nothing has ever checked whether that
sentence actually came true before a later SELL cites it; it has run on pure
honour system since day one. Full parsing of arbitrary English was earlier
ruled out as too unreliable to build. Rather than accept that guess, it was
measured against every real one of these sentences this desk has ever
recorded, and it was wrong: of 1,028 unique real conditions, 984 (96%) were a
plain moving-average reference and 38 (4%) were a bare price level — both
mechanically checkable against numbers this pipeline already computes. Only 6
(0.6%) were genuinely unparseable (a Bollinger Band mention, and a handful of
qualitative conditions like "guidance pulled" that no market data could ever
adjudicate). No RSI-threshold condition was found at all, despite that being
a plausible category on paper.

**Where the numbers came from, so they can be checked again:** the 20 real
executed trades whose recorded reasoning carried an `(invalid if: ...)` /
`(thesis_invalid_if: ...)` marker, all from `trades.reasoning`; and the fuller,
un-truncated `thesis_invalid_if` field recorded on 1,203 real tech-analyst
candidates (1,028 of them distinct text) in `specialist_evidence`. Both
sources agreed: the real writing is dominated by moving-average and
price-level language, not the free-form or indicator-heavy language the
"too hard to parse" assumption implicitly pictured.

**What was built, and what deliberately was not:** a small checker
(`check_thesis_invalid_if` in `src/risk/exit_guard.py`) that takes the
condition text plus whatever current price / moving-average values the
caller already has, and returns one of three answers — the condition is
provably TRUE now, provably FALSE now, or "don't know" — never a guess. It
refuses (never guesses) on a compound "this OR that" condition, an
indicator threshold, a moving-average period the pipeline doesn't compute,
or missing market data. It was deliberately NOT wired into any live
decision yet: it needs a proper, un-truncated place to read
`thesis_invalid_if` from on a real trade, which a parallel piece of work is
adding; reading today's truncated, reasoning-embedded text here would defeat
the point of building something more trustworthy than the honour system.
Tested against the real recorded sentences above (14 tests, all passing);
the test-breaking/restoring check that proves the tests actually exercise
the logic is recorded in the same session's work, not repeated here.

### 2026-09-03 — item 25: the Risk Manager's "did PM really have a reason to sell early" check was 100% prompt-only; now the two checkable parts are, one is not, and the fix only ever catches a proven-false claim

**In plain words:** the desk tells its AI Risk Manager to police an early
exit (a position sold before 5 days old, "protection period") by checking
that PM's stated reason is one of three real things — a triggered
invalidation, a market-wide flip to risk-off that day, or a genuinely
bearish news event about that stock that day — and to check the real News
and Macro data itself before agreeing. Nothing in code ever checked that it
did. The AI was grading its own homework, same shape as the sub-floor
catalyst gate fixed earlier today (§ above): a citation existing is not the
same thing as a citation being real.

**What's fixed and what isn't.** Two of the three triggers are now checked
in Python: (1) a claimed market-wide flip to risk-off is checked against the
day's own real macro reading; (2) a claimed bearish stock-specific news
event is checked against the day's own real news record. The third —
whether a stop-loss condition set at the time of the original purchase has
actually been triggered — is NOT checked. That would mean teaching code to
read an arbitrary written condition ("closes below the 50-day average") and
test it against a live chart, which is a much bigger, separate piece of
work, and a rough guess at it would be worse than admitting it isn't done.
Investigation also found that even the narrower question — "was a stop-loss
condition honestly written down at purchase time, not invented after the
fact" — cannot currently be answered reliably: the only place that record
survives is buried inside a length-capped free-text note, written two
different ways by two different parts of the code, and both are cut off
before the full note is guaranteed to fit. That gap is flagged for the
owner, not fixed here.

**Why a proven-false claim only gets logged, not blocked.** Whether the
market flipped to risk-off, or whether a specific bearish story broke on a
stock, are both checkable against real, single-source-of-truth data, so a
mismatch there is provable, not a guess. But the check still can't fully
trust its own reading of PM's sentence — matching words in free text cannot
always tell "the regime flipped" from "the regime did NOT flip," so a
wrongly-read sentence could look like a lie when it isn't. And even a
correctly caught false claim about these two triggers doesn't rule out the
third (the stop-loss one), which nothing here can check either way. So a
provably false claim is written to the record for review, not used to
cancel the trade — flagged for a second look before this graduates to
actually blocking anything.

**Update, same day, from independent review:** the "can't always tell a
claim from its denial" risk above was real, not theoretical — a reviewer
found a concrete sentence ("No regime shift to risk-off has occurred...")
that got misread as CLAIMING a flip before this fix, which would have
wrongly flagged an honest exit. A short negation check (a small list of
words like "no"/"not"/"without" appearing just before the matched phrase)
now catches this specific case. It is not a general fix for every possible
way free text can be misread — just this demonstrated one — which is
exactly why this still only ever writes to the record rather than blocking
a trade.

**Update, same day: the flat "<5 days" protection window itself is gone.**
The owner rejected the day-count as arbitrary — it traced to an April 2026
commit with a stated philosophy and no backtest behind it. Protection is
now decided by data, not a clock: a position keeps protection from a plain
sell-with-no-real-trigger UNLESS the level actually backing its thesis has
been broken by price. If the trade recorded its own "what proves this
wrong" condition (`thesis_invalid_if`), that condition is checked for real
using the price/moving-average checker built the same day
(`check_thesis_invalid_if`, see the entry above). If none was recorded, or
the checker can't parse it, the desk falls back to the same structural
support/resistance level — using the same already-agreed "at least 5 real
touches" bar that already decides whether a stop-loss is allowed to be
honoured (`portfolio_constructor.py::_level_backing_stop`) to pick WHICH
level backs the stop. No new number was invented anywhere in this change.
`days_held` no longer plays any part in the decision.

**Two corrections made the same day, after real technical-analysis
practice was checked rather than assumed.** First draft: any position with
neither a stated condition nor a qualifying structural level got no
automatic protection at all. The owner correctly flagged this as
systematically stripping protection from breakout/momentum trades, which
by design don't have classic multi-touch support/resistance under them —
that is not the same thing as "nothing backing the thesis." Fixed: that
case now falls back to the desk's EXISTING volatility noise band (the same
"is this adverse move real or just noise" check already used elsewhere in
this file) rather than an automatic unprotect — no second noise-band number
was invented for it.

Second, and more important: the first design lifted protection the moment
a break was seen on ANY single check, including mid-session. Checked
against real trading practice, that is wrong in two ways at once — an
intraday wick through a level that closes back inside is textbook noise,
not a break; and even a genuine CLOSE beyond a level can be a "spring" (a
well-documented false-breakdown pattern that often reverses bullish the
very next day), which can take a day or two to resolve, not one same-day
recheck. Fixed: a break is now judged ONLY on the completed DAILY CLOSE,
by a decisive margin (the existing noise-band multiple, not the tighter
number used only to identify which level a stop sits on), and must hold on
TWO CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAYS' closes before protection actually lifts — a
break-then-reclaim the next day resets to fully protected rather than
half-confirming toward a future break. The state needed to compare against
"yesterday's close" is a new small memory row (which trading day's close
came back broken, per position) added alongside the desk's existing
review-memory pattern, not a new architecture.

Real, hand-computed tests (not mocked) prove all of this, including the
most important case: a position whose close breaks a level on day one and
reclaims it on day two never loses protection (the spring case); the same
break confirmed on two consecutive days' closes does lift it; a close that
dips only slightly below a level (inside the noise-band margin) is never
read as broken at all — the same thing an intraday wick-and-recover would
look like, since the function only ever sees a close; a position with
neither a stated condition nor a qualifying level stays protected inside
the noise band and loses protection only once a real adverse move exceeds
it; and an intact thesis or level protects a position with no time limit
at all (30 "days held" makes no difference — there is no such input any
more). The two independent lift-protection triggers already shipped
(regime flip, bearish state change) are unchanged, are NOT subject to this
two-day confirmation gate (they still act same-day), and their existing
tests still pass. Still open, unrelated to this piece: the
`thesis_invalid_if` verification scope note above, and whether a
proven-false claim should ever escalate beyond logging.

### 2026-09-03 — the other four analysts finally reach the ranking, and one real bug caught on the way in

**In plain words:** the desk's tiebreak among tied stock picks only ever
listened to one of five analysts (technical), because that was the only
one whose output had been translated into the shared format the ranking
reads. The other four were built and wired in today, so the ranking now
genuinely reflects all five — not just in principle, but in the actual
code the desk runs.

**The catch, found while testing this, not before shipping it:** an
earnings filing's analysis carries a `symbol` field the AI itself writes
as part of its answer — separate from the symbol the pipeline already
knows the filing is about, from real deterministic record-keeping. Those
two should always agree, but nothing checked that they actually did. A
constructed test proved the gap was real (the ranking silently attributed
a reading to the wrong stock when the two disagreed), not theoretical.
Fixed: the pipeline's own record now wins, and a disagreement drops that
one earnings reading rather than trusting either side blindly. A follow-up
pass with no wrapper symbol to check against at all was also caught and
closed the same way, rather than trusting the AI's claim unverified.

**A second, more consequential bug, caught by an independent adversarial
review before this shipped, not by the original testing:** nothing stopped
the SAME analyst from voting twice on the SAME stock in one run — a real
case, since two filings for one ticker can legitimately land in one
session. That analyst's influence then silently doubled: a concrete
example moved earnings' effective say in a two-analyst tiebreak from half
to two-thirds, with nobody deciding it should. Fixed with the same rule
already used elsewhere on this desk for "which of several records about
the same thing counts": the newest one wins, the rest don't count twice.
Proven with a test that fails without the fix and passes with it, not
just written and trusted.

**What's honestly still open, not hidden:** macro's read is applied the
same way to every stock this run, not adjusted per sector the way the
older evidence display already does elsewhere in the same message to the
Portfolio Manager — a known simplification, not an oversight, since macro
doesn't carry a separate reasoning set per sector to draw from. And three
of the four new analysts' "how strongly does this argue" numbers are
reasoned estimates, not measurements — each one's own builder flagged this
explicitly rather than presenting a guess as settled.

**Verification:** all five pieces (four analyst conversions plus a
data-quality watchdog built the same day) were built independently, each
proven with real before/after test failures — not just written and
trusted. The wiring itself was tested end-to-end: a stock covered by three
analysts correctly outranks an identical stock only one analyst covers,
and three separate malformed-input cases (a broken earnings record, a
broken macro record, the symbol-mismatch case above) all confirmed to drop
gracefully rather than crash the run. Full paper-trading test suite: 4,552
passed; the only 12 failures were already-known, pre-existing gaps
unrelated to this change (confirmed by reproducing them against an
untouched copy of the codebase first).

### 2026-09-03 — analysts stop being treated equally in the ranking tiebreak

**In plain words:** the desk had a rule that analysts should never be
treated as interchangeable, and a separate, real, more-carefully-thought
rule (2026-08-31) saying no analyst gets extra trust until this desk has
personally watched it be right 20+ times. Both are correct on their own
terms, but together they meant "equal weight" for as long as it takes to
build that history — which could be weeks or months, and functionally
contradicts the first rule for the whole time. The fix: use REAL, published
outside research as a starting point instead of a flat default, while
still handing full control back to the desk's own track record the moment
it exists.

**What changed and where.** `src/verdicts.py::SEAT_WEIGHT` (Phase 13's
candidate-ranking tiebreak — decides which of several already-eligible,
already-agreeing stocks gets picked first, never how much money is risked)
moved from a flat 1-for-all weight to a per-seat multiplier: technical 1.2,
earnings 1.2 (the two most-replicated effects in the finance literature —
momentum and post-earnings drift), news 1.0 (real but narrow, and
specifically flagged in the literature as prone to looking good in testing
and failing in practice for LLM-generated sentiment — directly relevant to
this seat), smart_money 0.8 and macro 0.8 (both have documented edges that
are substantially eroded by exactly how this desk consumes them — insider
signals only look good before public disclosure, and macro's specific
turning-point-calling ability is one of the most repeatedly debunked
findings in applied economics, distinct from "macro conditions matter,"
which is well supported).

**What did NOT change.** `src/risk/rules.py::SEAT_WEIGHT` — the sizing
path that actually prices a position — is untouched and still requires the
desk's own 20+ resolved calls per seat before any weight applies, per the
2026-08-31 decision. That rule answers a different question (how good are
THIS desk's specific prompts, with real capital on the line) that outside
literature cannot answer for it. Extending the same treatment to sizing is
logged separately (`docs/WORK.md` item 30) because the sizing schedule is
built around whole-number agreement counts and a fractional weight needs
that schedule redesigned first — a second decision, not bundled into this
one.

**Currently has no effect on live behavior.** Only the Technical seat
produces a Phase 13 verdict so far; the weighting only changes anything
once a second seat is wired into the same shape.

---

### 2026-09-03 — the analyst scorecard got written up as missing work; it already existed

**In plain words:** the owner asked for a per-analyst track record — how
often each analyst is right, who argued for or against a trade, real
dollar P&L per seat. That was logged as new work to build today. It had
already been built and shipped four days earlier, under a different name
("the conviction ledger"), and was already running live in production.
Nobody checked before writing it up.

**Detail:** the search for this went looking for anything using Phase
13's `AnalystVerdict` shape (2026-09-03, same day) and found nothing,
because the real implementation predates Phase 13 and was built directly
against the trades/evidence tables instead — `docs/QAMC_REMEDIATION_SPEC.md`
§9.5, `src/api/routes_scorecard.py`, live at `GET /analysts/scorecard`,
merged 2026-08-31. It covers win rate, win/loss size, running P&L at fixed
risk, drawdown from peak, and per-trade credit attribution — everything
the new write-up asked for — already read-only and already ungated on
sample size. Caught before any duplicate was built, while gathering
context to hand a build off to another session; that context-gathering
step is what should have run first. `docs/WORK.md` item 29 corrected.

**In plain words:** a test file that checks the desk's cost-runaway
protection was still written against two settings that got deleted the day
before, when that same protection was rebuilt. Nobody updated the test to
match, so instead of testing anything it just crashes on startup. Found
while verifying an unrelated fix — the test failure was traced to a clean
copy of `main` with nothing else applied, confirming it predates and is
unrelated to that fix.

**Detail:** item 14 (2026-09-02) removed
`llm_cost_circuit.reservation_min_history_samples` and
`...session_reserved_exposure_limit_usd` from the config schema, replacing
that layer with `max_calls_per_session`. `tests/test_rehearsal_reproduces_cost_ceiling.py`
still builds a config dict using the two removed keys; `AppConfig` now
rejects the dict outright, so both tests in the file error before they run.
Not fixed yet — logged as `docs/WORK.md` item 28.

### 2026-09-03 — the risk manager and order-construction audit: six findings, after reading the code end to end for the first time

**In plain words:** on the same day the Portfolio Manager's decision code got
read line by line for the first time (rather than only testing its output),
two more layers got the same treatment — the code that turns a decision into
an actual order, and the separate AI ("Risk Manager") that reviews a trade
before it ships. Two independent reviews, run separately so they couldn't
copy each other, found the same top problem and five smaller ones.

**1. The biggest one — trades have been sized far below what the owner
actually approved.** The owner set the real per-trade risk limit to 5% of
the account, on the record, 2026-08-27. A much older number — 0.5%, ten
times smaller — was left over from a very early version of this code and
quietly wins every time the two are compared, with nothing connecting it to
any setting a person could change. Confirmed against real trade history:
trades that should have risked roughly $490 on this account instead risked
about $49, consistently, going back weeks. This predates the QAMC project
itself — the number is inherited from the original template this desk was
built on, from before the 5% rule ever existed, and nobody reconciled the
two when 5% was decided.

**2. The Risk Manager can edit a trade without anyone checking the edit is
actually safer.** The code that applies its changes only checks the edit is
formatted correctly — not that it tightens rather than loosens anything.
Observed directly in the trade history: the Risk Manager set two sell orders'
size to zero, which the system reads as "do nothing" — silently cancelling
two real exits the decision-maker had chosen, with only a sentence in the
AI's own instructions (not code) telling it not to do that. Also possible,
not yet observed: it could loosen a stop-loss past the minimum safety math
and nothing would catch it, because the safety checks compare the edited
trade against itself, not against the original.

**3. One safety net can be skipped after an edit.** A rule meant to shrink
new trades automatically during a losing streak doesn't get re-checked if
the Risk Manager increases a trade's size afterward. Never observed in
practice — the Risk Manager increasing a size has never happened in the
retained record — but real if it ever does.

**4. Same blind spot as the Portfolio Manager's, one level over.** When a
protected position is being sold, the Risk Manager is only asked to confirm
a reason was written down — not that the reason is actually true. Same shape
as the "catalyst door" problem found in the Portfolio Manager the same day.
A design question, not decided here.

**5. A small, low-risk bug.** A text-matching comparison is case-sensitive
where it shouldn't be — in the rare case of a formatting mismatch, an edit
the Risk Manager intended would silently not apply, and the trade would ship
as originally planned instead. Never observed live.

**6. A narrower calculation gap.** In an unusual situation where one kind of
market data is temporarily unavailable but another kind isn't, the system
can briefly forget that existing positions already carry risk, and approve
more new risk than the real limit allows. Documented as the exact failure
mode to avoid in the code's own design notes — it happened anyway, in a
partial-data case nobody had tested.

**What was checked and found solid, both reviews, independently:**
stop-loss placement, the math that rations money and risk across multiple
trades, and the mechanics of actually sending an order to the broker. No
gaps found in any of those.

**What would catch this next time:** none of these six had a test asserting
the two size limits agree, or that a Risk Manager edit is re-checked against
the same floors a fresh decision would face. Tests for both are part of the
fix work already dispatched for finding #1 and #2.

**Update, 2026-09-03 — finding #1 shipped.** `_qty_by_risk_budget` now reads
`config.risk.max_position_risk_pct` (fallback 5.0, the ratified value) the
same defensive way the constructor's own sizing reads it, instead of the
hardcoded `RISK_BUDGET_PCT = 0.5`. Kept as a genuine independent recheck
against the REAL executed stop/entry geometry — only the stale percentage
was the defect, not the mechanism. Before/after on realistic geometry
(entry $100, stop $90, $9,850 book, 20% allocation): the risk-budget leg
alone now allows ~49 shares (5% × $9,850 / $10 risk-per-share) versus ~4-5
before (0.5%) — the constructor's own allocation is now the binding
constraint in the ordinary case, as intended, instead of this recheck
silently re-capping it tenfold. Findings #2-#6 remain open.

---

### 2026-09-03 — Phase 13, first increment: the desk now says which of the twelve

**In plain words:** on 2026-09-01 the desk's own rules let twelve stocks
through and then went quiet — nothing said which of the twelve to prefer, so
the model picked however it liked. Now every analyst report is being moved
onto one fixed shape (which way, how strongly, how sure, what evidence, and
what would prove it wrong), and the portfolio manager is handed the eligible
names IN ORDER, with the arithmetic beside each one and the refused names
listed with the rule that refused them. Only the technical analyst is on the
new shape so far; the other five seats are next. No weighting was invented:
every signal counts once, as the owner ratified, until a seat's own record
shows it deserves more or less.

**What shipped.**

- `AnalystVerdict` (`src/models.py`): seat, symbol, direction
  (bullish/bearish/neutral) + magnitude 0..1, conviction (high/medium/low),
  structured evidence (labelled numbers, dated events, or observations — a
  bare label is refused), and an invalidation condition. A directional call
  with no invalidation or no evidence does not validate. A neutral verdict
  is the absence of a call: it may be blank, but it may not lean.
- `TechAnalysisResult.to_verdict()`: a restatement, not a second opinion.
  Rating → direction and magnitude (`strong_* = 1.0`, `buy/sell = 0.5`,
  equal spacing of the desk's own two-rung scale); conviction verbatim;
  evidence = entry/stop/target/R/R, the selected levels, and the five
  reasoning-chain steps; invalidation = `thesis_invalid_if`, or, on the ~2%
  of reads where the model left it blank, the analyst's own hard stop —
  the text says which.
- `src/verdicts.py::rank_verdicts`: score = magnitude + conviction score
  (low/medium/high → 0/0.5/1), weight 1.0 each, seats averaged at unit
  weight, ties on symbol. No min-max across the set, so a name's score
  does not move when a peer joins. Seats disagreeing on direction are not
  ranked — that is §9.3's conflict to adjudicate, not a number to hide.
- `PortfolioManagerAgent.candidate_eligibility` + `rank_candidates`: the
  item-18b gates R2–R5, ported from the audit script into production and
  cross-checked against it on the real fixture (12/12 identical —
  `tests/test_analyst_verdict.py` pins that they cannot drift apart). R4's
  catalyst clause is looser than the post-decision rule on purpose: before
  the decision exists there is no citation to check, only whether one is
  possible. Nothing after submission was touched — `_apply_subfloor_
  catalyst_rule`, `validate_grounding`, the R/R arithmetic and the risk
  budget are exactly as they were.
- A new prompt section, `## Candidate Ranking`, after the Technical
  reports. The floor it gates on is the one threaded into `decide()`, so
  the PM is ranked on the rule it is held to.

**What the real day looks like under it.** Run-64290730, Technical only:
XLE first at 1.50 (`buy` + `high`), then COP, CVX, FLNC, MSFT, NKE,
NVDA, PATH, PFE, TSM all tied at 1.00 (`buy`/`sell` + `medium`), then CHPX
and CRM at 0.50 (`low`). **Nine of twelve tie.** With one seat and two
ordinal signals the composite makes three tiers, and inside a tier the
tiebreak is alphabetical — a stated rule, and a meaningless one. The audit's
`rank_eligible()` separates all twelve because it also reads R/R and net
independent evidence. Whether those two join the production composite is a
design choice the owner has not made; this pass did not make it for him.

**What was deliberately not done.** The other five seats (news, macro,
earnings, smart money, evening) still hand up their old shapes. No per-seat
reliability weight exists — there is no measured record to derive one from
(`_CONVICTION_OUTCOME_MIN_N`). The ranking is shown, not enforced: it does
not size, does not gate, and does not stop the PM taking a lower-ranked
name — it asks the PM to say what the ranking does not see. Whether the
model actually follows the order is a model-behaviour question and needs the
paid `--replay-run` benchmark, which this pass was not authorised to spend.

**What would catch a regression.** `tests/test_analyst_verdict.py`: the
shape refuses incomplete verdicts; all 59 production reads on the fixture
day map to valid verdicts; the production eligibility admits exactly the
audit's twelve; the order is pinned; a refused name is never ranked even
when it would have outscored every admitted one; an AST scan fails on any
seat-keyed weight table in the ranking module.

### 2026-09-03 — item 17(a)/(b): a database hiccup shouldn't need a human, and a failed alert shouldn't vanish

---

### 2026-09-03 — a risk-manager "modification" could silently cancel an exit or ship a trade a fresh one would have been refused

**In plain words:** the Risk Manager is allowed to edit a trade to make it
safer — trim the size, tighten the stop. Nothing ever checked that an edit
actually did that. Two ways that went wrong in real trading, both now closed.
First: the Risk Manager can edit a SELL or COVER's size down to zero, and at
execution a size of zero silently means "don't do this" — so an edit that
was supposed to just resize an exit could make the exit disappear entirely,
with no visible record that anything had been cancelled. This happened live
on 2026-08-24 on two symbols. Second: the Risk Manager can also widen a
stop-loss or move a target, and nothing re-checked whether the RESULT still
cleared the same two safety floors a brand-new trade has to clear — the
reward-to-risk ratio staying above 1.5, and the stop staying far enough from
entry that it isn't a coin-flip on ordinary daily noise. An edit that broke
either floor still shipped, because both checks only ever compared the
edited trade against itself, never against what it looked like before the
edit.

**The fix, `_apply_risk_modifications` (`src/pipeline.py`).** Two guards
added, both inside the same function that already applies field edits and
already drops a decision outright when an edit fails schema validation
(that part was correct and unchanged):

1. **An exit's allocation can never be silently zeroed by an edit.** If a
   SELL/COVER's `allocation_pct` would be edited down to zero, the edit is
   refused and the exit ships at its PRE-edit size instead — a real
   refusal of the trade has its own, separate mechanism already
   (`RiskVerdict.rejected_symbols` / `SymbolRejection`, handled earlier in
   `RiskStage.run`), so a modification is not overloaded to mean "cancel
   this," and the refusal is written to the same visible pipeline-event
   stream every other risk outcome already uses (`kind="pipeline_event"`,
   `outcome="modification_rejected"`) instead of vanishing.
2. **A stop/target edit is re-measured against the real floors before it
   ships**, using the exact same arithmetic the constructor itself uses
   (`TradeDecision.reward_risk`, which is `models.reward_to_risk` — the one
   ratio definition this codebase already shares end to end) against the
   same `REWARD_RISK_FLOOR` (1.5) constant, plus — only when real price bars
   are available to compute a genuine ATR reading — the same configured
   noise-band floor (`RiskConfig.absolute_min_stop_atr_multiple`) the
   constructor's `_widen_stop_past_noise` enforces. Either breach reverts
   the single field edit (the rest of the modification, if any, and the
   rest of the plan, are unaffected) rather than shipping a trade a fresh
   decision would never have been allowed to reach. When bars aren't
   available to compute a real noise-band check, that half is skipped
   rather than guessed at — the R/R floor half still runs regardless.

Deliberately NOT touched: the Risk Manager's real authority to make a trade
safer (tighten a stop, shrink a size, refuse a trade outright via
`rejected_symbols`) — those paths are unchanged and still apply exactly as
before. This is narrowly about an edit that looks like a change but behaves
like an uncaught refusal or an uncaught loosening.

**Also fixed in the same pass, item 24-equivalent:** the post-modification
re-filter call to `_filter_hard_risk_decisions` (`pipeline_stages.py`,
`RiskStage.run`) was dropping the `in_drawdown` flag the pre-modification
call one screen above it already computes and passes — defaulting to
`False` regardless of the account's real drawdown state, for no reason tied
to what the Risk Manager did. Now both calls pass the same `in_drawdown`
value.

**What would have caught it sooner:** a test asserting a modification
result is MORE protective than the input, not merely schema-valid — none
existed. Six new tests now cover both guards plus the untouched happy path
(genuine tightening still applies exactly as before), and one test asserts
the `in_drawdown` value matches across both filter calls in the same run.



**In plain words:** two related gaps closed. First, a brief database hiccup
("I cannot read the budget right now") used to shut off all paid analysis
just as hard and just as permanently as a real, measured overspend ("I am
over budget") — both required a human to clear a file by hand before trading
could resume. Now a hiccup gets a few quick retries first and only shuts
things off if it keeps failing; a real overspend still shuts off instantly,
exactly as before. Second, the alert that is supposed to tell the owner
"paid analysis just got shut off" could itself fail to send — and until now
that failure just vanished: nothing else happened, and nobody could tell
later whether the owner had ever actually been warned. Now that failure is
written down where a later run will find it and try again, and the running
count of failed attempts is visible wherever the circuit's status is
checked, so it cannot go unnoticed forever the way it did on 2026-09-02.

**(a) — infra fault vs. real breach.** `LLMCostCircuitBreaker` had exactly
one outcome for "something went wrong touching the ledger": the durable,
cross-process file latch (`mark_unavailable`), fired on the very first
exception. That conflated two different situations that were already
mechanically distinct everywhere else in the module: a real, measured
spend breach is recorded by `_trip_locked` straight into the in-database
`llm_circuit_state` row and was never routed through the file latch at all
— it already latched immediately and correctly. Everything that DID reach
`mark_unavailable` (construction, session activation, the preflight
spend-check) was, by construction, an infrastructure/config problem, never
a breach — so retrying it before latching could never accidentally delay a
real overspend.

The fix adds `LLMCostCircuitBreaker._run_with_infra_retry`, wrapping the
three places that read/seed the ledger before any money is at stake
(`_initialize` at construction, `activate_session`, and
`enforce_current_limits`, which backs the `require_paid_analysis` preflight
gate). It retries a bounded number of times with exponential backoff, then
escalates to the exact same durable latch as before. `PaidAnalysisSuspended`
/ `OptionalPaidAnalysisRetrySkipped` — the real-breach signal, when it
surfaces through one of these paths — passes straight through unretried,
so a genuine breach is never delayed by this change. The call-accounting
paths (`begin_call`, `before_provider_attempt`, `complete_call`,
`fail_call`, `status`) are deliberately untouched: they run after a call has
already been authorized or settled, where an automatic retry of a write
carries more risk than the conservative fail-closed-immediately behavior
already in place there.

The retry count and backoff shape are not a new number invented for this:
they mirror `MacroConfig` (`src/config.py`) — the bounded
exponential-backoff-with-jitter retry this codebase already uses for FRED's
transient network faults (`MacroDataProvider._next_backoff`,
`src/data/macro.py`) — reused as
`LLMCostCircuitConfig.infra_fault_max_retries` /
`infra_fault_retry_backoff_base_s` / `_max_s` / `_jitter_s`, same defaults
(2 retries, 2s doubling to 8s, 1s jitter).

**(b) — a failed alert must be persisted and retried, not dropped.** The
sentinel object that fires the "paid analysis suspended" alert
(`UnavailableLLMCostCircuit`) tracked delivery success only in an in-process
boolean. If the Telegram send failed and the process then exited (or simply
never touched the circuit again), that failure was both terminal and
invisible — nothing durable recorded that the owner had never actually been
told. This is exactly what happened on 2026-09-02 (see item 17c's entry
above): the database fault latched, and the alert about it also failed to
send, with no trace.

The fix folds alert-delivery bookkeeping (`alert_delivered`,
`alert_attempts`, `last_alert_attempt_at`) into the SAME durable JSON marker
`mark_unavailable` already writes for the latch itself — deliberately not a
database row, since the whole scenario this sentinel exists for is the
database being the thing that's broken. Every time any circuit boundary is
touched (session activation, a preflight check, a fresh process after a
restart), the sentinel re-reads that marker: if already delivered, it stops
trying; if not, it retries the send and records the outcome, success or
failure, back into the file. `alert_attempts` and `alert_delivered` are also
surfaced through `status()` (already read by session summaries and would
feed Mission Control), so a string of failed attempts is visible on that
surface, not just in process logs. A genuine second notification channel
does not exist in this codebase yet (Telegram is the only one), so this
ships the "at minimum, durably recorded and retried" half of the original
ask; a real second channel is a separate, larger decision and is called out
in `docs/WORK.md` rather than invented here.

**What was NOT decided here:** whether to build an actual second alert
channel (e.g. email/SMS/PagerDuty) beyond Telegram. That is a new paid
dependency and a real design tradeoff, not a retry-count choice — flagged
for the owner in `docs/WORK.md`, not decided unilaterally.

**Tests added** (`tests/test_cost_circuit.py`): a transient DB-open failure
retries with backoff and does not latch on the first occurrence, but does
latch once retries are exhausted; a real, measured spend breach still
latches immediately with zero retries and never touches the file latch; a
failed alert send is durably recorded and successfully retried by a later
process; and repeated alert failures across several simulated process
restarts keep accumulating in the durable record (and on `status()`)
instead of silently disappearing after the first attempt.

### 2026-09-03 — the silence-alarm timing was set to owner instruction, not a placeholder

**In plain words:** the silence watchdog (item 17c) shipped with a one-full-day
placeholder — the desk would have to be dark for an entire trading day before
anyone was told. The owner rejected that on sight: every hour the desk sits
silent is an hour of open positions nobody is watching, real money at risk,
not an abstract number. He set it to roughly one hour instead.

**Why one hour is still a reliable signal, not a false-alarm risk.** The
check is desk-wide — it only counts silence when EVERY one of the six daily
jobs has gone quiet at once, not just one. A single job skipping is normal
and happens for mundane reasons; the whole desk going quiet across two
independent scheduled slots in a row is not something that happens by
accident on a healthy desk. Shortening the window from a full day to about an
hour trades away tolerance for a genuinely unusual event that was already
rare, in exchange for finding out about a real outage in an hour instead of
by the end of the day.

**What changed:** `DEFAULT_SILENT_WINDOW_THRESHOLD` in `src/silence_watchdog.py`
went from 6 to 2. The `DECIDE BY` line this shipped with in `docs/WORK.md` is
resolved and removed accordingly.

---

### 2026-09-03 — the macro "no defect" audit finding was wrong; the sanity check overrides most regime-shift calls, and it's a calibration gap, not a broken pipeline

**In plain words:** a prior audit said the macro analyst's "regime shift"
warning was just a sanity check working correctly once in a while. Checking
real logs shows it fires on roughly half of every macro run, not
occasionally — but the underlying data pipeline turns out to be healthy.
The real problem is a number in the rule that assumes government/market
data refreshes faster than it actually does, so the check almost never lets
a genuine regime call through. Fixing that number is a risk-appetite
decision for the desk owner, not something to change without asking, so it
is flagged rather than silently changed.

**Detail.** `docs/WORK.md`'s DATA QUALITY AUDIT item 6 claimed "Macro
analyst — no defect." Checking `journalctl` for the `qamc` user
(2026-08-17..09-02, 27 retained macro_analyst runs) found the warning
`Macro sanity-check: LLM set regime_shift=True but only N indicator(s) are
fresh (staleness_days <= 1) ... clearing regime_shift` on 14 of those 27
runs (52%) — 10 with zero fresh indicators, 4 with exactly one (3x vix,
1x credit_spread). The production DB (`agent_logs`) has 33 total
macro_analyst calls; the retained journal covers 27 of them (six 2026-08-31
reruns rotated out of retention).

Traced via `src/agents/macro_analyst.py`'s `_apply_sanity_checks`: a
`regime_shift=True` call is only allowed to stand if >= 2 of the six
primary indicators (vix, treasury, fed_funds_rate, inflation, unemployment,
credit_spread) have `staleness_days <= 1`. Inflation/unemployment are
monthly and were already known to never qualify (by design, documented in
the same function). The new finding: treasury and fed_funds_rate — both
DAILY series — also essentially never qualify. Nine production checkpoints
(`data/checkpoints/*-morning.json`, 2026-08-18..09-02) show treasury and
fed_funds_rate at `staleness_days=2` in 9 of 9 samples, never 1. A live
check against FRED's own public `fredgraph.csv` endpoint on 2026-09-03
confirmed this is not a fetch bug: DGS10, DGS2, DFF, VIXCLS and
BAMLH0A0HYM2 were ALL sitting at a real, current 2-business-day lag at
query time — FRED itself had not yet published a fresher print for any of
the five daily series checked. The pipeline is correctly reporting what
FRED actually has.

Net effect: of six primary indicators, only vix and credit_spread ever
reach `staleness_days<=1`, and only intermittently (2 of 9 sampled days
each) — and both must land on staleness=1 on the SAME day to clear the
>= 2 bar. That coincidence is rare, which is exactly what production
showed. This is a genuine calibration bug (the `<=1` bar assumes a
same/next-day FRED lag that the real world does not deliver), not a fetch
or pipeline defect — the fetch code, retry logic, and per-cadence
"staleness" labeling used elsewhere in the same file (the `confidence`
gate, `_stale()` in the prompt builder) are all measured-correct and were
NOT changed.

**What was NOT done, and why.** The obvious fix — loosen `staleness_days
<= 1` to something reachable, e.g. `<= 2` or `<= 3` — was deliberately not
made. The `<= 1` bar is an explicit, reasoned risk-calibration choice
written into `config/prompts/macro_analyst.md` ("calling a flip on stale
data is guessing"), and replacing it with a different number is a
risk-threshold decision, not a factual correction. That decision belongs to
the desk owner. See the `docs/WORK.md` DECIDE BY line for the options
considered (loosen the bar, keep it deliberately strict and accept
regime_shift rarely fires, or source VIX from a same-day feed instead of
lagged FRED data).

**What shipped:** the corrected `docs/WORK.md` item 6, this record, and a
regression test (`test_sanity_check_clears_regime_shift_under_realistic_fred_lag`
in `tests/test_macro_analyst.py`) that pins the current, measured behavior
using realistic (not zero-staleness) fixture data, so a future change to
this gate has to consciously decide to change this documented outcome
rather than drift into it.

---

### 2026-09-11 — the day-count itself was the wrong question; none of the three options above was taken

**In plain words:** the decision above asked which calendar-day limit to
pick for "is this economic data too old to trust" — loosen it, keep it
strict, or switch to a same-day feed for one indicator. None of those was
chosen. The day-count was removed instead, because it was never the right
kind of test for this data. A government economic reading is not stale
because a few days passed; it is stale because a NEWER reading exists and
this one hasn't been updated to match. Inflation and jobs numbers are only
published monthly — a 20-day-old inflation reading is not old, it is
simply the only one that exists yet.

**What replaced it.** The check no longer counts days at all. It asks
whether the number on hand is the newest one that has actually been
published, and separately, whether a newer one was due by now and never
showed up (the real failure this desk needs to know about — a feed
quietly breaking). A reading that is legitimately the latest one gets
used, however many days old it is; a feed that has gone genuinely quiet
past its own normal publishing schedule raises its own alert instead of
silently degrading the macro read. Full build: `docs/WORK.md` was item 6's
DECIDE BY line — removed, decision superseded rather than answered, since
none of its three options describes what shipped. Code:
`src/data/macro.py`'s `SeriesFreshness`, wired through
`src/agents/macro_analyst.py`.

**What this fixes in practice:** the sanity check was clearing roughly
half of all real "the market's mood just flipped" calls (measured 2026-09-03,
above) purely because the freshness bar could not be met by ordinary,
healthy data. That should now happen only when data is genuinely
overdue, not on every ordinary FRED publishing lag — not independently
re-measured against live production yet, since this ships forward, not
against the same historical window.

---

### 2026-09-03 — the news analyst wasn't dropping data, it was tripping over one dropped quote mark

**In plain words:** a rare news-report failure looked structural ("4 fields
missing entirely") and was flagged as unsolved because nobody could see what
the model actually said. The real answer was almost funny: the model wrote
a complete, correct report and then forgot to type one opening quote mark.
That one missing character made the whole thing look broken. Fixed by
teaching the parser to notice and repair that exact typo. Also found, while
checking: the instrumentation built on 2026-09-02 specifically to diagnose
this (PR #217, raw-payload capture to `data/parse_failures/`) was never
actually running on the live box — production was 40 commits behind
`main`, deployed before that PR even existed. The deploy-drift alarm (see
the 2026-08-27 entry below) should have caught this and did not; that is a
second, separate gap, reported as-is and not fixed here.

**What was checked and found.** `data/parse_failures/` does not exist on
the production box — the capture code was never deployed. Confirmed via
`git merge-base --is-ancestor`: the box's HEAD (`7f582209`, deployed
2026-09-02 15:30 ET) does not contain the capture commit (`55632b85`,
merged 2026-09-02 20:32 ET) or the 39 other commits after it. So "zero
failures captured" was not a data question (too early, too rare) — the
capture mechanism itself has never run in production.

**How the real root cause was recovered anyway.** `agent_logs.full_response`
is a separate, older capture path that stores the raw LLM text for every
call regardless of parse outcome, and it was already deployed. Pulled the
row for the exact failure the doc referenced (2026-09-02 19:30 ET,
`agent_logs.id=365`) and read it directly: the JSON was complete and
correct except that the `pm_briefing` key was missing its opening quote —
`  pm_briefing": "..."` instead of `  "pm_briefing": "..."`. That single
character breaks whole-document `json.loads()`. `AgentResult.parse_json()`
then falls back to scanning the text for any well-formed JSON fragment and
picking the best-scoring one — but no fragment of a document broken this
way can contain the four required top-level fields at once (they were
scattered on both sides of the break), so the scanner picked an inner
sub-object instead and pydantic reported exactly "4 fields missing." Ruled
out: truncation (`finish_reason='stop'`, `truncated=0`, only 1017 output
tokens — nowhere near any ceiling) and a schema/prompt mismatch (every
field the schema wants was present in the model's answer, correctly
shaped). It was a one-character JSON formatting slip, nothing more.

**A second, different structural failure was also found in the same
history** (2026-08-25 15:00 ET, `agent_logs.id=176`): the model dropped an
entire stock symbol's key (`"AMD": [`-style opener) mid-array, splicing one
symbol's news items directly onto another's. This is NOT the same defect —
there is no missing character to reinsert, the model omitted information
that cannot be safely guessed back. Left unfixed; forcing a repair here
would mean inventing data. It surfaces today as an ordinary validation
failure, same as before.

**The fix.** `AgentResult.parse_json()` (`src/agents/base.py`) now tries
one extra, narrowly-scoped repair before falling back to fragment
scanning: if the whole text fails to parse, look for a line that starts
with a bare word immediately followed by `":` (a closing quote with no
opening one) and add the missing quote, then retry the parse. This is safe
specifically because Anthropic's pretty-printed JSON always starts a key on
its own line, and a JSON string can never contain a literal newline — so
that pattern can only ever be a key position, never the middle of a string
value. Applied to both the raw text and to text extracted from a fenced
code block. It fixes only the exact defect that was actually observed —
deliberately not a general "fix any broken JSON" attempt, which would be
exactly the guessing this investigation was set up to avoid.

**Overall news_analyst health, checked independently of this one issue.**
71 real calls in the retained `agent_logs` history (2026-08-14 to
2026-09-03): every one has `status=success`, `finish_reason=stop`,
`truncated=0` — no token-budget problem like the smart_money seat had.
2 of 71 (2.8%) hit a JSON-malformation structural failure (the two above).
9 of 71 (12.7%) used a `market_sentiment` value outside the accepted enum
(`mixed`, `mixed-to-bearish`, `risk-off`) — this is the SAME defect already
on record in `docs/WORK.md` (the vocabulary-rejection finding), re-measured
here and confirmed still live and unfixed as of this check, not a new
finding. No empty or truncated `pm_briefing` text found among the
successfully parsed reports.

### 2026-09-03 — item 17c: a watchdog for the desk going silent, not just the alarm breaking

**In plain words:** on 2026-09-02 the desk stopped doing any work at all — a
database fault latched trading off — and nobody was told, because the only
existing check (`quant-agent-alert-heartbeat.timer`) only proves the
Telegram messaging pipe works, not that the desk is actually running
sessions. Worse, the alert about that specific fault also failed to send.
This ships the missing half: an alarm that fires on the ABSENCE of a
completed session, across every scheduled mode, rather than on any one
known failure — so it catches this incident and any future one shaped like
it, imagined or not.

**What "a completed session" means, and why not `agent_logs`.** A crashed
or partially-run session can leave `agent_logs` rows behind (one LLM call
succeeded before the crash), so their presence does not prove a session
finished. Instead this reuses `alert_channel_checks` — the table
`src/alert_watchdog.py` already owns — keyed by `source`. Every one of
`main.py`'s six scheduled modes writes exactly one row there from its
`finally` block, which is reached even when the pipeline body raised. That
write already existed for an unrelated reason (proving the sessions
exercise the Telegram path); this is a new READER of state the trading path
already produces, not new instrumentation on it.

**Desk-wide, not per-mode.** The six modes
(`earnings_preprocess`/`morning`/`intra_check`/`midday`/`close`/`evening`)
are one desk taking turns through a day, not six independent things to
watch separately — a single mode legitimately producing nothing one day
(e.g. `close` with no open position to review) must not read as an outage
while the others run fine either side of it. So "silence" is judged across
all modes together: any completed session in any mode counts as evidence
the desk is alive.

**Why a persisted "last known alive" marker instead of re-scanning the
database every run.** The failure this watches for includes "the database
cannot be opened" — the same database a naive design would have to re-query
on every check. `data/alerting/silence_heartbeat.json` (same on-box pattern
and reasoning as `scripts/alert_heartbeat.py`'s heartbeat.json) carries the
timestamp of the last known completed session forward across runs. Each run
tries to advance it from the database; if the database cannot be read, the
marker simply does not advance, and the elapsed-window count keeps growing
on wall-clock time alone. The alert itself goes out through
`src.notifier.send_owner_alert`, which never touches this database, so a
broken database cannot suppress the alert about itself.

**One alert per silence episode.** The same on-box record tracks which
"last known alive" baseline an alert was already sent for, so a still-silent
desk does not get paged on every 30-minute tick — only once per continuous
episode, clearing when a fresh session is recorded (mirrors
`alert_heartbeat.py`'s consecutive-failure reset-on-success shape).

**What shipped:** `src/silence_watchdog.py` (the check), `scripts/
silence_heartbeat.py` + `scripts/run_silence_heartbeat.sh` (the CLI entry
point, same `.env`-sourcing wrapper shape as the existing heartbeat), and
`scripts/systemd/quant-agent-silence-heartbeat.{timer,service}` (installed
the same way as the existing heartbeat unit — not installed on the live box
by this change). Tests in `tests/test_silence_watchdog.py` cover: no alert
on a healthy schedule; a single legitimately quiet mode not triggering while
others run; a full day of desk-wide silence crossing the threshold; the
alert firing exactly once per episode and again after a later, separate
episode; an unreadable database still letting the streak accumulate to an
alert rather than going blind; and weekends never manufacturing a false
alarm (no scheduled windows exist on a weekend, matching
`run_if_et_window.sh`'s own weekday gate).

**What was NOT decided by this work, and must not be read as decided:** the
threshold — how many consecutive scheduled windows of silence before
alerting — shipped as a placeholder of 6 (one full scheduled trading day).
No agent may pick a threshold like this unilaterally, same rule item 14's
`max_calls_per_session` placeholder followed; it is recorded as an open
decision in `docs/WORK.md`, not silently finalized.

**Left alone, explicitly out of scope for this change:** items 17(a) (a
transient infrastructure fault should retry-with-backoff rather than latch
immediately) and 17(b) (a failed alert should be persisted, retried, and
escalate to a second channel) are unchanged — both are sequenced after (c)
in `docs/WORK.md` and neither was touched here.

---

### 2026-09-03 — the desk's own report was blaming the wrong stage for a blocked trade

**In plain words:** when a proposed trade never turned into a fill, the desk's
own conversion report tried to say why. If the Risk Manager vetoed the whole
plan, the report blamed the Risk Manager for EVERY symbol PM had originally
asked for — even ones the deterministic constructor had already dropped
earlier in the same run, before the Risk Manager ever saw them. That made the
Risk Manager look like the cause of blocks it never touched, and hid the
constructor's own (perfectly good) reason for dropping them.

A companion script (`scripts/blocked_proposals_census.py`, built 2026-09-02)
already did this attribution correctly; the desk's own live reporting code
(`_outcome` in `src/pipeline.py`) did not, so the two tools disagreed on the
same data.

**Fixed in two parts, same day.** First, a symbol is only ever blamed on a
Risk Manager veto if it's confirmed to have reached the constructor's own
order list — a symbol the constructor dropped earlier no longer qualifies
(PR #215). Second, once the constructor's own drop reason started being
saved to the database (funnel-queue item 2, same day — see
`PortfolioConstructor.last_drop_reasons`), the live reporting code was taught
to read it, so a constructor-dropped symbol now shows the constructor's real
reason instead of falling into the unexplained "no order was ever built"
catch-all.

**Verified against the correction the census script already had.** Ran both
the desk's own report and the census script over the same historical
database; conversion rate and every block-reason count matched exactly.
Added a regression test that drops one symbol at the constructor and lets a
Risk Manager veto reach the two survivors, and asserts the dropped symbol is
never credited to the veto.

---

### 2026-09-03 — alerts stop relying on colour

**In plain words:** every critical alert on this desk opened with a
coloured circle (🔴 critical, 🟠 hold) and colour was doing all the work of
telling the reader how bad something was, with no text fallback. This is
item 21(b) in `docs/WORK.md`, owner spec 2026-09-02.

**What changed.** Every 🔴/🟠 alert opening in `src/notifier.py`,
`src/pipeline_stages.py`, `src/trader_feed.py`, `scripts/alert_heartbeat.py`
and `scripts/run_if_et_window.sh` now uses a shape instead of a coloured
disc — 🛑 for stop/critical, ⚠️ for a degraded/hold state that needs no
immediate action — and every one of those messages now leads with a plain
English severity word (`FAILED`, `SUSPENDED`, `CRASHED`, `KILLED`,
`INCOMPLETE`) so the message is still correct read with zero emoji
rendering. One condition — a held position with ZERO stop-loss coverage,
unbounded loss, the single most catastrophic state on this desk — is marked
🛑🛑🛑 (repetition, not colour, marks the top severity tier); a partially
covered stop is downgraded from the old 🔴 to ⚠️ since a stop IS still
standing watch over most of the position.

**What was deliberately left alone.** `src/cost_circuit.py` and
`src/pipeline.py` still open alerts with 🔴/🟠 — both were being edited by
other sessions in parallel and touching them risked a merge collision;
someone still needs to apply the same shape/text-severity treatment there.
`src/alert_watchdog.py`'s self-test failure/recovery messages and the
generic per-mode status legends in `src/notifier.py`'s and
`src/trader_feed.py`'s own `_status_emoji` helpers (used for every routine
run summary, success included, not just alerts) were read but not touched:
they already carry a plain-text `status:`/`Status:` line immediately below
the coloured circle, so the colour is not the *only* signal there, but
they are visually inconsistent with the rest of the desk now and a good
candidate for the same shape treatment later.

**Tests.** Updated `tests/test_notifier.py`, `tests/test_daily_report.py`,
`tests/test_ops_audit_round2.py` and `tests/test_intraday_scan_crash_visibility.py`
to assert the new shapes and leading severity words instead of the old
colour + informal word order. Full suite run alongside; no regressions
beyond the two pre-existing `tests/test_rehearsal_reproduces_cost_ceiling.py`
failures (that suite reads live production state and is expected to fail
inside a worktree).

---

### 2026-09-03 — item 14: the budget guard was stopping the desk on money it never spent

**In plain words:** before every LLM call, the desk set aside cash to cover
it, priced at a worst-case rate. The real bill came in at roughly a third of
that estimate, so the desk was holding 2.6x what it actually spent — and
would shut itself off on money that was never really gone. On 2026-09-02 this
stopped the desk three times in one hour: once on a stuck latch needing a
manual reset, twice on a projection ($2.69 "reserved" against $0.55 actually
spent). Actual daily spend is $0.73-$1.14 against a $2.75 ceiling — this
guard never once caught a real overspend, only phantom ones.

**Why the old design couldn't be tuned, only replaced.** The token estimate
per call was already fixed once (2026-08-28); the remaining error was the
PRICE per token, pinned to the worst case because `allow_fallbacks` means a
saturated cheap tier can silently land on the full rate. Reserving at the
cheap rate "to fix the padding" would have traded a false alarm for a real
uncovered overrun on exactly the days it matters. There was no honest number
to tune it to.

**What shipped, owner-approved 2026-09-02, on `feat/replace-budget-reservation`.**
Deleted the entire per-call reservation layer along with the projection-based
triggers built on it (including a never-wired afternoon spending reserve —
docs/WORK.md item 16, now moot). Replaced with two independent checks: a
settled-cost cap against real spend only (nothing to estimate, nothing to be
wrong about — the maximum overshoot is one call, under a dollar), and a plain
per-session call-count cap, since a runaway loop is a rate of calls, not a
dollar figure, and a count cannot mis-price anything. A third layer, an
API-key-level spend cap enforced by the provider outside our code, was
approved but is NOT built — the exact limit options OpenRouter offers were
never verified.

**Also found and fixed on the same branch:** a retry that succeeded after an
initially-refused attempt was being charged for both attempts (real overcharge
was pennies, but this exact mechanism put $1.90 of imaginary spend on the
ledger and darkened the desk twice in one day back in August); and a pricing
gap that could have latched the desk off permanently with no self-heal path.
A failed call that can't be proven to cost $0 no longer gets an invented
dollar figure — it now marks the day/session as inexact so the settled-cost
check fails closed instead of guessing.

**Found and deliberately left alone, reported not fixed:** a session killed
mid-call at day's end could leave a stale reservation that the next morning
charges and latches on, so the day it darkens isn't the day it broke (read
from code, never observed live). Cache hits record no cost, so an alert can
print `cost: $?.??` and hide the real figure.

**The call-count number, set from real data, owner-approved 2026-09-03.**
Shipped first with a 60 placeholder because no measured figure existed. Owner
asked whether it could be pulled from logs before shipping instead of
guessed. Queried the live desk's `llm_budget_sessions` table directly (real
production data, not the benchmark): the worst COMPLETE, successful session
ever recorded made 14 calls, and crashed/halted sessions in the same table
show FEWER calls, not more — they got cut off early, so they don't hide a
higher real ceiling. That volume is almost entirely `tech_analyst` chunking
the ~101-symbol universe; the `portfolio_manager` makes exactly one call
every session, no exceptions, so a call-count runaway would come from the
cheap analyst layer, not the PM. Shipped at **40** — roughly 3x the measured
ceiling — with an explicit reconfirm-after-a-few-days-live note in
`docs/WORK.md` rather than treating 40 as final either.

### 2026-09-03 — item 18a/18b: the pipeline traced, and the desk's own rules run as code

**In plain words:** we finally read the whole of what the model is handed,
and then we wrote the desk's own buying rules out as plain arithmetic and ran
them on the same day. The rules narrow 59 analysed names down to 12 that are
allowed to be bought — and then they stop. Nothing in the rulebook says which
of the 12 to take. **We have been blaming the model for a choice we never
specified.** Worse, the rules explicitly permit NVDA and MSFT, the two names
the benchmark punishes it for taking, while deterministically refusing three
of the five best short candidates of the day.

Reproduce either half with no LLM call:
`python -m ops.model_policy.deterministic_selection`, and
`tests/test_deterministic_selection.py` pins every number below.

**(a) The trace, from the rendered prompt — not from code comments.**

The assembled user message for run-64290730 is **199,139 characters**. Every
section in item 18's earlier table reproduces to the character, so that
measurement is confirmed rather than merely repeated. The single assembly
point is `PortfolioManagerAgent.build_user_message`; there is no second
channel.

**Does each seat CONCLUDE or TRANSCRIBE?** Same test item 18 applied to
earnings, applied to the rest:

| seat | chars | share | shape | verdict |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Earnings | 140,107 | 70.4% | 67 reports x 8 extraction fields + one `Analyst synthesis` line | **TRANSCRIBES** |
| Technical | 17,409 | 8.7% | 59 lines: rating, conviction, R/R, entry/stop/target, `Invalid if`, one-line why | **CONCLUDES** |
| Source Agreement | 11,902 | 6.0% | deterministic per-symbol net counts | machine output, not a seat |

| BUY Eligibility | 853 | 0.4% | the list of what may be bought | — |
| Smart Money | 93 | 0.05% | "No material source-backed finding available" | **ABSENT on this day** |

So the transcribe-not-conclude problem is **not** universal, and the
hypothesis in item 18 is now answered: technical and news hand over real
conclusions, macro is a short call followed by six sub-sections of recital,
smart money contributed nothing at all, and earnings is the whole of the
problem. Within earnings the one-line conclusion is 15,706 of 140,107
characters — **11.2%**. The largest single field is `Data quality`
(19,098 chars, 13.6%), i.e. the seat spends more prose describing how bad its
input was than delivering its verdict. Item 20 wants exactly that field
extracted as a status; it is already there, as prose, 67 times.

**(b) The rules as code. Six gates, replayed on run-64290730.**

R1 current technical coverage · R2 rating actionable · R3 longs must be
BUY-eligible · R4 computed R/R ≥ 1.5 or a catalyst resolving to a dated
Active News State Change row naming the symbol (then capped at 0.5% risk) ·
R5 net independent source score ≥ 1 (§9.4 refuses net ≤ 0) · R6 conviction
sizing band under the 5% single-name cap.

59 analysed → 12 eligible. Blocked: 21 on R2, 41 on R4, 14 on R5.

| symbol | dir | R/R | net | max risk % | door in |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| CHPX | long | 3.03 | 2 | 1.00 | R/R floor |
| NKE | short | 2.28 | 1 | 2.00 | R/R floor |
| FLNC | short | 1.84 | 1 | 2.00 | R/R floor |
| XLE | long | 1.67 | 2 | 3.00 | R/R floor |
| PFE | long | 1.50 | 1 | 2.00 | R/R floor |
| PATH | long | 1.32 | 2 | 0.50 | catalyst |
| NVDA | long | 1.03 | 3 | 0.50 | catalyst |
| MSFT | long | 0.85 | 2 | 0.50 | catalyst |
| TSM | long | 0.83 | 2 | 0.50 | catalyst |
| COP | long | 0.76 | 3 | 0.50 | catalyst |
| CRM | long | 0.48 | 2 | 0.50 | catalyst |
| CVX | long | 0.39 | 2 | 0.50 | catalyst |

**The rules do NOT determine an answer.** Their combined maximum risk is
**13.5% against a 25% total-risk budget** — every eligible name fits at once,
so no cap forces the desk to drop even one. There is no ranking rule
anywhere: the rulebook gates and ceilings, it never orders. Twelve permitted
names, no tiebreak, no "best". That gap is the whole of what the model is
actually doing at this step, and it is unspecified.

**Two consequences that were not visible before.**

1. **The sub-floor catalyst door is a famous-names-only door.** Seven of the
   twelve eligible names are sub-floor and enter solely by citing an Active
   News State Change row. Those rows are written from the wires, and the
   wires cover mega-caps — NVDA, MSFT, TSM, COP, CRM, CVX. So the rulebook
   itself hands the model a list on which the famous-and-weak names are
   **legally admissible**, at 0.5% risk. The benchmark's `familiarity_bias`
   check then fails the run for taking them, while `rr_floor_discipline`
   passes it for taking them correctly. The two are jointly satisfiable — a
   book of CHPX/XLE/PFE/NKE/FLNC passes both — but **the model is being
   graded against a rule the desk does not state anywhere in its prompt.**
   This is a mechanism, not a model-behaviour explanation, and it is
   deterministic.

2. **Three of the five "qualified shorts" are refused by our own arithmetic.**
   GEV (R/R 2.12), UNH (1.90) and NEE (1.84) clear the floor and are still
   dropped: the §9.4 signed score nets a bullish earnings stance off the
   bearish technical one, giving GEV −1 and UNH/NEE 0, and there is no rung
   at or below zero. The `familiarity_bias` check's stated premise is that a
   model choosing on evidence "lands on the unglamorous names" — naming GEV,
   NEE and UNH. **A model that took them would be overriding a deterministic
   refusal.** NKE and FLNC do survive, so `takes_a_qualified_short` is still
   satisfiable; the scenario is not broken, but its reasoning is wrong about
   three of its five names.

**What was ruled out.** Not a model-behaviour finding: no LLM ran. Not a data
bug: every number above comes from the frozen fixture through production
code. Blinding already disproved the "it decides before reading" claim twice
and nothing here revisits it.

**What would catch this next time.** `tests/test_deterministic_selection.py`
asserts the 12-name set, the three refused shorts, and the block census, so a
rule or config edit that changes the shape of the day fails in CI without
spending anything.

**(c) The missing ranking step, built at the ratified equal weight —
2026-09-03. NOT WIRED INTO ANYTHING.**

`rank_eligible()` in the same script fills the gap (b) found, using only the
owner-ratified default: a weighted composite **starting equal-weight**. No
weight was tuned, no threshold introduced, no signal invented.

Which of `evaluate()`'s per-candidate numbers are admissible as score inputs,
and why the rest are not:

| field | in? | why |
|---|---|---|
| `rr` | yes | primitive, continuous |
| `net_sources` | yes | primitive, integer |
| conviction | yes | ordinal, encoded by the desk's OWN `CONVICTION_BANDS` band tops (low/medium/high → 1/2/3). Not a new number. |
| `aligned`, `opposed` | no | `net_sources` IS aligned − opposed; scoring all three counts one piece of evidence three times |
| `agreement_ceiling_pct` | no | a pure function of `net_sources` (the §9.4 lookup) — double-weights evidence |
| `max_risk_pct` | no | a function of conviction, the ceiling and the sub-floor cap; it re-imports the R/R gate the ranking must be independent of |
| `subfloor_catalyst`, `held`, `eligible` | no | booleans restating gate outcomes, not candidate strength |

So three independent signals, min-max normalised across the eligible set onto
0..1, summed at weight 1.0 each, ties broken on symbol. All three span the
full range on this day, so none is a dead input.

**The output on run-64290730, highest to lowest:**

| # | symbol | score | rr | net | conviction |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | XLE | 1.9848 | 0.4848 | 0.5000 | 1.0000 |
| 2 | NVDA | 1.7424 | 0.2424 | 1.0000 | 0.5000 |
| 3 | COP | 1.6402 | 0.1402 | 1.0000 | 0.5000 |
| 4 | CHPX | 1.5000 | 1.0000 | 0.5000 | 0.0000 |
| 5 | PATH | 1.3523 | 0.3523 | 0.5000 | 0.5000 |
| 6 | NKE | 1.2159 | 0.7159 | 0.0000 | 0.5000 |
| 7 | MSFT | 1.1742 | 0.1742 | 0.5000 | 0.5000 |
| 8 | TSM | 1.1667 | 0.1667 | 0.5000 | 0.5000 |
| 9 | FLNC | 1.0492 | 0.5492 | 0.0000 | 0.5000 |
| 10 | CVX | 1.0000 | 0.0000 | 0.5000 | 0.5000 |
| 11 | PFE | 0.9205 | 0.4205 | 0.0000 | 0.5000 |
| 12 | CRM | 0.5341 | 0.0341 | 0.5000 | 0.0000 |

Reported plainly and NOT claimed to be better than the model's book. For
reference only: across the five recorded `pm_selection` trials on this
fixture the model opened baskets of 7–11 of the 12, so it never ordered them
and never chose one; the six names it took in all five runs were XLE, CHPX,
NVDA, PATH, NKE, FLNC, five of which are in this ranking's top six (it ranks
COP 3rd and FLNC 9th). Whether that agreement means anything is unmeasured.

**Status: audit artefact. Nothing in `src/` calls it.** Wiring it into the
selection path would be a production-behaviour change and is explicitly NOT
done here. Before it could ever gate a real trade it needs the project's own
paid-benchmark verification rule run against it, and the owner's review of the
order above. Equal weight is a ratified STARTING point; only an out-of-sample
measurement may justify moving it. `tests/test_deterministic_selection.py`
pins the order and the scores, so the table cannot rot silently.

### 2026-09-03 — item 10 (repeat-proposal memory) re-measured: too early to tell, and the fix cannot close this alone

**In plain words:** the desk got a fix on 2026-09-02 so it can now SEE which
names it keeps asking for and never gets. This re-measures whether that
actually stopped the re-asking. Short answer: there is not enough real
trading since the fix landed to tell yet, and even with more data the fix as
built cannot close this by itself — it was built, on purpose, to show the
problem, not to stop it.

**What `wt/stuck-loops` actually shipped.** The real feature is
`feat/blocked-trade-memory` (`630da15`/`f3165bd`, merged 2026-09-02 03:39
UTC) — `_build_blocked_proposals` in `src/pipeline.py`, rendered as the
portfolio manager's `## Proposal Conversion` prompt section: an aggregate
conversion rate plus up to 5 repeat-offender names (3+ proposals, zero
fills, rolling 21 days). The later `680da41` (18:30 UTC same day) did no new
feature work — it independently verified the above and hardened two
untested branches in the same function. Read verbatim from the code's own
docstring: **"Diagnostic only. Nothing here gates, filters or caps
anything... Whether a repeat block should ever restrict a name is a
separate, unmade decision."** The desk can now see it is burning slots on a
name; nothing stops it from asking for that name again anyway.

**Re-measured against the live production DB (`/home/qamc/quant-agent/data/quant_agent.db`,
copied read-only).** A `scripts/desk_reset.py` run — a real, intentional
tool, not a bug — flattened the book at 2026-09-02 18:18:59Z for an
unrelated reason (the reward:risk geometry defect; see the proposal-to-fill
census entry above) a few hours after the memory fix landed. It wipes
`trades`, `positions`, `intraday_evaluations`, and every decision-shaped row
in `specialist_evidence` (`target`, `proposed_order`, `verdict`,
`execution_skip` — the exact rows `_build_blocked_proposals` reads), while
keeping raw analyst observations. Consequence: as of this snapshot, those
four row kinds have exactly ONE row between them in the whole table,
timestamped 2026-09-02 18:31:29 — a single proposal (ORCL), which was
allocated, passed the risk manager, and filled the same minute.

Between the fix landing (03:39 UTC) and the reset (18:19 UTC) — the one
window where the fix was live against un-wiped history — the portfolio
manager ran 12 times and produced **zero** targets at all (proposals need a
positive size; none of those 12 runs wrote one). One run (19:00 UTC, after
the reset) analyzed NVDA — a pre-fix repeat offender — but did not propose
it. None of the other pre-fix repeat offenders (JPM, VLO, PATH) were even in
that day's candidate universe.

**Honest verdict: PARTIALLY CLOSED, and not fully closeable by this fix
alone.**
- The memory gap named in item 10 ("the desk has no memory of having
  already been refused") is fixed — `_build_blocked_proposals` gives the PM
  exactly that memory, independently mutation-tested (see `680da41`).
- Whether that memory actually changes what the PM proposes is UNTESTED,
  not confirmed. Zero repeat-offender re-proposals happened since the fix,
  but the entire post-fix, pre-reset window produced zero proposals of any
  kind, and the post-reset window is nine hours old with one proposal in
  it. That is not evidence the desk stopped re-litigating burned names —
  it is an absence of any names being proposed at all to litigate.
- Even with more days of data, the fix cannot close item 10 on its own: it
  is diagnostic by explicit design. Actually stopping slots from being
  burned on a repeat name would mean gating or capping a proposal based on
  its prior-refusal count — a new risk/quality threshold (how many refusals
  before a block, and for how long), which is an owner decision, not one
  to make unilaterally in this pass.

  > counts and are superseded. The owner refused the framing outright
  > ("this proposal is a hack, not a solution") and directed that it be

**Recommendation, not a decision:** re-run this measurement after several
full trading days have accumulated post-reset (the 21-day lookback needs
that much history to say anything about a 3+ repeat pattern), and treat
"should a repeat block ever restrict a name" as its own open decision for
the owner — it is already flagged as such in `docs/AGENT_ROLE_AUDIT.md`
§1.6.
> **CORRECTION, 2026-09-14.** The second half of that recommendation is
> withdrawn: it is not an owner decision and is no longer open. See the
> 2026-09-14 entry at the top of this file. The first half — re-run the
> measurement — stands, and was done on 2026-09-14.

### 2026-09-02/03 — funnel item 8 ("stop on the wrong side of entry") checked, not a code defect

**In plain words:** the census found 2 of 68 proposals refused because the
stop price was on the wrong side of the entry price — a stop that could
never actually protect the trade. The refusal itself is correct and stays;
the question was what produced a broken stop in the first place.

**Why:** nothing produces a broken stop. Traced backward from the refusal,
through `_resolve_stop`, to the technical analyst's own output validator
(`src/models.py`), which already guarantees a proposal's stop sits on the
correct side of its OWN entry price at the moment it's created — the
analyst never emits a self-contradictory pair. No sign-flip, unit-conversion,
or rounding bug anywhere in that chain.

**What actually happens:** `PortfolioConstructor` prices the trade off a
live quote fetched fresh at construction time — after macro, news, earnings
and the portfolio manager have all already run, so real time has passed.
Measured against a production database snapshot, that live price can land
seconds to minutes and several percent away from the price the analyst's
entry/stop pair was computed against. One real case (DIS) moved -1.8% in
108 seconds against a stop only 2.2% from entry, landing $0.48 from
flipping outright. Ordinary price movement in that window can carry the
market through a perfectly sound stop level before the trade is ever
constructed. That is not a data-quality bug to fix upstream — it is the
refusal correctly catching a stop that is no longer valid by the time the
trade would be placed.

**New test** `tests/test_shorts_stage3.py::test_long_stop_breached_by_live_price_since_analysis_is_rejected`
covers the live-quote path (the existing test only covered the synthetic
`suggested_stop_price` path). No source change — this is a documented
non-fix.

---

### 2026-09-02/03 — funnel item 5 ("allocation rounds to zero shares") checked, not a live defect

**In plain words:** the census found 3 of 68 proposals died because a
$9.9k-scale account tried to buy a $200+ stock and the share count rounded
down to zero. Fractional sizing was already on, so the open question was
whether it was actually being used for these three, or getting bypassed.
Checked in code — it is not a current bug.

**Why:** fractional sizing merged 2026-09-01 23:24 UTC. The census window
runs 2026-08-18 through 2026-09-02 18:01 — 14 of its ~15 days predate
fractional sizing existing at all, when every BUY floored to a whole share
regardless of account scale. That matches what the 2026-08-29 census already
concluded about this same cause, before fractional was even built (see the
ranked-causes table below).

**Verified directly in code**, not just by timeline: in
`src/pipeline_stages.py`, `_fractional_sizing_allowed` is resolved BEFORE
`_size_shares` floors anything, so a BUY on a broker-confirmed-fractionable
symbol cannot round to zero at this account scale — the 4-decimal floor only
reaches zero below a 0.0001-share raw quantity, far under any allocation this
desk sizes. New test
`tests/test_fractional_sizing.py::test_a_9_9k_account_sizes_a_200_dollar_stock_without_rounding_to_zero`
pins the census's own $9.9k/$200+ numbers as a regression guard;
`test_a_sub_one_share_position_is_taken_not_skipped` already covered the
general case.

**Ruled out, not assumed:** a stale/disabled config flag (checked
`config/settings.yaml` and `src/config.py` — `fractional_enabled: true` in
both); a floor applied after fractional rounding that could re-zero it
(`below_min_notional` is a distinct, separately-recorded skip reason, never
folded into `qty_zero`); wrong evaluation order (fractional eligibility is
decided first, size second, correctly).

**What can still legitimately produce `qty_zero` today**, and is not this
defect: a SHORT (a borrowed share cannot be fractional —
`_fractional_sizing_allowed` returns `False` before even asking the broker,
per `test_short_entries_are_always_whole_share`), or a symbol the broker does
not confirm `fractionable` for (fails closed to whole shares, per
`test_non_fractionable_symbol_falls_back_to_whole_shares`).

**Not confirmed:** which of the 3 historical hits were shorts/non-fractionable
symbols versus ordinary pre-fractional-era longs — the backing
`data/resets/20260902T181859Z/quant_agent.db` is not in this checkout, only
on the live desk. Re-measure the census against a fractional-sizing-only
window before spending more time on this line.

---

### 2026-09-03 — funnel item 2 (constructor-dropped share): the reason always existed, it just wasn't kept

**In plain words:** the census found 19 trade ideas across a two-week window
that just vanished — no database row, no explanation an operator could find.
Nearly a fifth of everything the desk considered. It turned out the desk DID
know why, every single time — it just never wrote that reason down anywhere
a later query could reach.

**Why:** the constructor (the code that turns a target allocation into an
actual order) drops a target for many real reasons — the reward:risk floor,
a missing structural stop, a sector-crowding refusal, about 20 different
call sites in total — and every one of them already logs a real sentence
explaining why. But that sentence only ever went to the log file. Nothing
persisted it to the database, so `scripts/blocked_proposals_census.py` (the
tool that answers "why didn't this trade happen") had nothing to read and
filed all 19 under an unhelpful generic bucket.

**The fix, and why it's not a rewrite:** threading a distinct reason string
through all ~20 places the constructor can drop a target would touch a
stateless, heavily-tested core sizing function in ~20 places — a much
larger, riskier change for the same outcome. Instead, a log handler scoped
to exactly one `construct_orders` call captures the constructor's own log
lines and exposes them on the object afterward. The caller then writes one
database row per dropped symbol, in the constructor's own words, instead of
nothing. The reason was never missing — only unrecorded.

**What this does not fix:** runs before this shipped still have no such row
and still fall into the old unexplained bucket — this cannot retroactively
explain history, only prevent it going forward. It also does not address a
separate, structurally different 9-item shape where an order WAS built and
then nothing else appears in any record at all (looks like an interrupted
run, not a swallowed reason) — that is still open and needs its own
investigation.

---

### 2026-09-11 — the other 9: not an interrupted run, four ordinary reasons the report just couldn't read yet

**In plain words:** the 9 remaining cases from the entry above — where an
order looked like it was being built and then the trail went completely
cold — turned out not to be silent failures at all. Every one ran to
completion, and the desk explained itself every time. The explanation just
wasn't written to the place a later report could find it.

**What the 9 actually were, once traced: 4 real incidents, not 9 mysteries.**
A malformed safety-check response correctly aborted a whole trading plan.
Three proposals were skipped because the account genuinely didn't have the
cash yet. One was blocked for pushing too much of the account into one
sector. One was blocked because that stock had no supporting research that
run. All four are ordinary, correct behaviour — nothing crashed, nothing
hung, no order vanished mid-flight.

**One correction to how the cash case was first described.** It is NOT a
settlement-delay issue — paper trading does not gate same-day buying power
behind a multi-day wait. The real, already-fixed bug (2026-08-19): the
system credited a stock sale's proceeds as available cash the moment the
sell order was *submitted*, without confirming it had actually *filled* —
so a buy could be sized against money that was never really freed if the
sale hadn't gone through yet. That is a confirmed-vs-assumed-fill bug, not
a settlement wait, and it was fixed the same day it was found.

**The actual gap, closed today:** three of the four reasons above were
already being saved correctly by the pipeline — the reporting tool that
reads them back just never learned to look for them, so a real, already-
recorded reason kept showing up on this report as "no explanation." Fixed:
the report now reads all four reason types.

**What this means for the anxiety behind this whole item:** the failure
mode that mattered most — something breaks with zero way to ever know why
— did not happen here. This was a reporting gap, not a control failure.

**What would catch a regression:** `tests/test_blocked_proposals_census.py`
proves all four causes are correctly attributed against a real database,
plus a guard that the already-working cash-cause path stays working.

---

### 2026-09-03 — item 15 (price provenance), position-mark slice shipped

**In plain words:** every price the desk uses was just a bare number, with
nothing recording where it came from or how old it really was. Held
positions now carry that record; live quotes and chart data don't yet.

**What shipped:** a rescued, never-reviewed branch (`rescue/price-provenance`,
uncommitted dev-account work from 2026-08-21) added a `PriceObservation`
shape — value, price_kind, provider, feed, market_as_of, retrieved_at,
freshness — and wired it onto held positions' `current_price` as
`position_mark`. That slice applied cleanly against current main and is now
live: `broker_reads.read_positions()` tags every position with a real
`retrieved_at` (via a `_utc_now()` seam, mockable in tests) and correctly
marks `market_as_of: None` / `freshness: "unknown"` for a broker mark, since
Alpaca's position endpoint supplies no mark timestamp — never fabricated as
fresher than it is. Two pre-existing tests needed the new field added to
their expected shape; both fixed, not weakened.

**What did NOT ship, and why:** the rescue branch also touched live quotes
and historical price bars (a dedicated free-IEX-feed market-data client),
but main had independently rewritten `read_price_bars()`/`get_prices()` to
support multiple timeframes in the 11 days since the rescue's base commit —
two different implementations of the same function, left as unresolved
`.rej` files on the rescue branch. Reconciling them means picking which
implementation wins, which changes how the desk fetches live/historical
prices used elsewhere — a real architecture decision, not a mechanical
merge, and out of scope for an unattended pass. This is also the half that
items 5, 9 and 11 on the funnel-queue actually need (quote/bar freshness,
not position-mark freshness), so it remains genuinely open.

Two frontend components (`PositionsPanel.tsx`, `PriceChartPanel.tsx`) also
still need manual reconciliation against main's independent UI rewrite —
not attempted here. The TypeScript type additions for `PriceObservation`/
`position_mark` were applied to `client.ts` so the API contract is typed
correctly even though no component renders the new field yet.

---

### 2026-09-02 — the full proposal-to-fill census: where every trade idea actually dies, counted, not guessed

**In plain words:** the desk had a stale "23% of proposals become a fill"
number and no complete breakdown of why. This is the complete count, over
the whole recorded history, of every proposal and exactly what killed the
ones that did not fill. The 1.5 reward:risk floor already had a name and a
paper trail (see the entries below); this is the first time it was counted
alongside every OTHER cause on the same footing, so it can be ranked instead
of assumed.

**Data used.** `/home/qamc/quant-agent/data/quant_agent.db` was reset live,
mid-measurement (2026-09-02 18:18:59Z — `scripts/desk_reset.py`, flattening
8 positions and wiping `trades`/`intraday_evaluations`/the decision-linked
half of `specialist_evidence`, citing the reward:risk defect below as why
that history was "contaminated"). The reset script itself copied the
pre-wipe database to
`data/resets/20260902T181859Z/quant_agent.db` before deleting anything —
that copy is what this census is built from. It carries the full recorded
history: `specialist_evidence` 2026-08-17 through 2026-09-02 18:01, `trades`
2026-08-14 through 2026-09-02 17:02, 104 distinct runs. It supersedes the two
older `data/quant_agent.db.bak-*` files (both stop at 2026-08-28) and is the
only complete copy left once the reset runs.

**Denominator: 68.** That is every `target` (PM proposal) with a positive
size — an entry request, not an exit — recorded from 2026-08-18 through
2026-09-02. 15 of the 68 filled (22%, matching the stale figure — it was
stale in detail, not in headline). 53 did not.

**Ranked causes (of 53 blocked):**

| n | % of 68 | cause | classification |
|---|---|---|---|
| 17 | 25% | reward:risk floor (1.5) — 10 killed before an order was ever built (`PortfolioConstructor._widen_stop_past_noise`), 7 killed by the AI Risk Manager citing the same floor by name in its veto text | RULE TOO STRICT |

**Direct answers to the six questions asked of this data:**

1. *Died at the 1.5 reward:risk floor specifically?* **17 of 68 (25%)** —
   confirmed as the single largest NAMED cause, ahead of every other rule.
   It is not, however, the majority of blocked proposals (53) the way "the
   single largest cause" might imply — the unrecoverable-gap bucket (13) is
   close behind it, and together the two dwarf everything else.
2. *Died for lack of a structural level to anchor a stop?* **3 of 68**,
   all on one day (2026-09-02) under a check that shipped 2026-09-01. Real,
   but currently small next to the reward:risk floor — one day of data is
   not enough to say whether it stays small.
3. *Died at the cash/exposure clamp rather than a risk rule?* **1 of 68.**
   Not a material cause over this window, whatever it may become at larger
   size.
4. *Died to something that looks like a bug rather than a rule?* Two
   patterns qualify: the 2 wrong-sided stops (#8 above — the constructor's
   refusal is correct, but a stop landing on the wrong side of entry at all
   means something upstream produced a self-contradictory number), and the
   9-of-53 `order_not_placed` shape specifically (constructor built the
   order, nothing in any table or surviving log says what happened next —
   no trade, no skip, no rejection). The second is the stronger DEFECT
   candidate: that shape is exactly what an interrupted or crashed run
   looks like from the outside, not what a deliberate no-trade looks like.
   Separately, `agent_logs`/`specialist_evidence` record 14 outright agent
   failures in this window — 10 of them `portfolio_manager:
   no_valid_grounded_decision` on 2026-08-25 alone, which is why that date
   produced zero proposals at all rather than merely zero fills.
5. *Sessions with zero fills, and the dominant cause on each?* **6 of the 11
   sessions that produced at least one proposal** (55%): 2026-08-18 and
   2026-08-19 (dominant: unexplained gap), 2026-08-20 and 2026-09-01
   (dominant: reward:risk-floor veto by the Risk Manager), 2026-08-24
   (dominant: orders cancelled after submission), 2026-08-28 (dominant:
   reward:risk floor at the constructor).
6. *Same symbol repeating across refusals?* NVDA was proposed **9** times
   and filled **once** — by far the most repeated name, and its 8 misses
   are spread across nearly every cause on the list above, not one. Three
   symbols were proposed 3+ times and filled **zero**: JPM, VLO, PATH.

**What could NOT be attributed, and how much of the total that is.** 13 of
68 proposals (19% of all proposals, 25% of blocked ones) resolve to
`no_order_built` or `order_not_placed` with no supporting record anywhere —
not in `specialist_evidence`, not in `trades`, and not in the systemd
`journalctl --user` history (which otherwise reaches back to 2026-08-09 and
resolved another 15 of the 68 by cross-referencing the constructor's own log
lines against proposal timestamps — that cross-reference is what produced
the #1 reward:risk-floor figure above; the constructor logs no reason to
any table, only to `logger.info`/`logger.warning`). One specific run
(`run-5834d319-dec-51d3bf`, 2026-08-31 ~19:06) has ZERO constructor log
lines in the journal despite producing a real verdict and real trades
minutes later — either that invocation didn't run under the systemd unit
this journal captures (a manual/replay run's stdout goes nowhere this
census can reach), or its logging was lost some other way. This is reported
as a genuine gap, not resolved further.

**What this does NOT change.** The reward:risk floor's value (1.5) and the
level-backed-stop exemption (spec §12.1) are unchanged by this entry — see
the 2026-08-31 and earlier entries below for that history. This entry adds
the ranking and the complete count; it does not re-litigate the threshold.

**Reusable going forward:** `scripts/blocked_proposals_census.py` — regenerates
every number above (and the per-day / per-symbol breakdowns) against any
`quant_agent.db` snapshot. Read-only, no pipeline imports, no broker calls.

### 2026-09-02 — the phantom bill was only half fixed, and a model going out of print could have switched the desk off for good

**In plain words:** two ways the desk could stop itself over money it never
actually spent. The first was the 2026-08-31 phantom charge, still alive on
the half nobody looked at. The second was worse: if the model marketplace ever
stopped listing one of our models, the desk would have shut down and stayed
shut down, with no way back except a person editing a file by hand.

**Neither was costing much. Both could cost a trading day.** Measured over the
clean period 2026-08-27 to 2026-09-02 (2026-08-31's own numbers only after the
operator's ledger correction that afternoon), real spend runs $0.73–$1.14 a
day against a $2.75 ceiling, and the Portfolio Manager is 93% of it — $4.25 of
$4.56 on 35 of 153 calls. Nothing found here moves that. What they move is
uptime, and an unattended desk that stops does not restart itself.

**The phantom charge survived on the branch where the retry works.**
`fail_call` learned on 2026-08-31 that a 429/400/401/403/404 or a pre-send
transport failure provably billed nothing. `complete_call` never learned it.
So when the first attempt was refused and the *second one succeeded*, the
refusal's conservative reserve was still added on top of the real cost of the
response we got and paid for. It happened twice in the recorded ledger:
tech_analyst on 2026-08-28 at 14:31 booked $0.0135 against a real $0.0014
(9.6x), news_analyst on 2026-08-31 at 14:36 booked $0.0126 against $0.0023
(5.4x). Two cents in total — and the same mechanism that put $1.90 of
imaginary spend on the ledger and darkened the desk twice in one day. The
direction matters and it is worth saying plainly: this error runs AGAINST the
desk. It never hides spending; it invents it, burns the day's budget with it,
and stops trading early on money that was never charged.

**Fixed the same way, deliberately: the same allow-list, the same contagious
ambiguity.** One attempt that might have been billed and the whole reservation
is charged exactly as before. A caller that cannot say what its attempts
failed with keeps the old behaviour, so this can only ever forgive more
genuinely-free attempts, never fewer.

**The pricing latch had a third door, and it was the one that could not be
walked back through.** The 2026-08-28 grace window fixed a stale price list.
It did not fix a price list we could read that simply did not carry one of our
models — and OpenRouter retiring a model id is an ordinary event, not a fault
(`google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite` is already refused to new Google keys). That
path returned "no pricing", which suspends paid analysis behind the durable
operator-reset latch. It could not recover on its own, because a successful
fetch **writes the cache before the completeness check runs**: every later
session read the same fresh-but-incomplete file, never re-fetched, never
reached the grace window, and failed identically. An unattended desk could
have been switched off indefinitely by a deprecation notice it had no part in.

**What was wrong was the premise, not the number.** That check can only ever
name a model that is already a row in the pinned baseline table in
`src/cost_table.py` — a verified, dated, drift-checked rate. "There is no rate
at all", which is what failing closed asserts, was never true for anything it
could name. It now prices that one model from its pinned rate, keeps the live
rate for every model the catalog did price, and shouts. The ceiling is
untouched: the call is still priced, still reserved, still counted, and a
model genuinely withdrawn answers 404 — which the zero-cost allow-list already
accounts at $0, so the seat fails safely per-call while the desk keeps
trading.

**Deliberately NOT changed, and someone should decide about it.** The pinned
`openai/gpt-5.5` rate is $5/$30 per million and the PM seat routes to the
`openai/flex` endpoint — provider-reported cost has been a **median 0.38x** of
the pinned estimate over 32 calls since 2026-08-28. Reservations, and
therefore the reserved-exposure ceilings, are sized from the pinned rate, so
every PM reservation is roughly **2.7x** what the seat actually gets billed.
That is what produced the 2026-08-28 hold ("would project session cost to
$1.9118, above ceiling $1.80") on a call that really cost about $0.25 — and
the response was to raise the ceiling from 1.80 to 2.60. The mis-measurement
is quietly loosening the real protection. It is NOT safe to just price
reservations at the flex rate: fallbacks are enabled, so a saturated flex tier
lands on the $5/$30 endpoint and the reservation would then under-cover
exactly the call that costs most. This needs an owner decision, not a patch.

**Also found, also not changed.** A session killed mid-call at the end of a
trading day leaves an attempted reservation that nothing sweeps until the next
session runs — which is the next morning, when the sweep charges it and raises
the hard latch. The day it darkens is not the day it broke. Never observed;
reported because the shape is the same as every incident above.

### 2026-09-02 — one word the model spelled differently could bin a whole stock analysis, and 118 other fields could do it too

**In plain words:** when an analyst wrote "nothing to say here" as an empty
blank, the system accepted it. When it wrote the same thing as the word
`null`, the system threw the *entire* analysis away — the rating, the entry
price, the stop, all of it — and only a log line said so. The specific field
this was found on had already been patched. The problem was that 118 more
fields could do exactly the same thing, and nobody was counting the losses.

**What was measured, not assumed.** Against the production response log for
2026-08-14..2026-09-01:

| field | explicit nulls | occurrences | status before |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TechAnalysisResult.thesis_invalid_if` | 42 | 2,021 | patched 2026-09-01 |
| `MissedOpportunity.theme_durability` | 25 | 50 | **still exposed** |
| `MissedOpportunity.universe_addition_reason` | 11 | 50 | **still exposed** |

The evening pair is the sharper case: half of all `theme_durability` slots
came back null, and each one silently deleted that whole missed-opportunity
entry from the quarterly theme aggregation. Replaying the stored responses,
12 entries that the desk had discarded now parse.

**What it actually cost, and what was RULED OUT.** The 42 nulls fall across
28 distinct symbols in 4 responses. Of those 28, **4 were lost permanently** —
EQNR on 2026-08-20, and AMT, EQIX and PLD on 2026-08-25. Those two batches
logged `90/91 symbols analyzed, 1 failed` and `84/87, 3 failed`, and the failed
symbols are exactly the null-carrying ones the retry did not rescue. The
remaining 24 were recovered by a bounded retry — a paid extra LLM call each
time, and invisible afterwards because a rescued batch reports `data_status`
"ok".

**What does NOT hold up** is the causal link to the zero-trade morning of
2026-09-01. Every one of the 42 null-carrying analyses — including all ten
that morning — was rated `neutral`, verified from the raw stored JSON
independent of the models, and that batch logged `58/58 symbols analyzed`
with nothing lost. A `neutral` read proposes no trade, so **no tradeable
candidate has been shown lost to this defect**, and the zero-trade day has a
different cause. What the defect demonstrably cost is 4 analyses, some paid
retry round-trips, and a failure mode that would have been invisible had it
landed on a `buy`. The fix is justified by that plus the exposure — not by a
lost trade, and it should not be described as one.

**The real cause.** Pydantic checks a field's declared type before any
whole-object rule runs, so an explicit null on a field that is not marked
optional is fatal even when that field declares a perfectly good default. An
omitted key and a null key mean the same thing to the model writing the JSON;
they meant opposite things to the parser. Fixing them one at a time loses by
attrition — there were 119 such fields.

**What was ruled IN, and what deliberately was not.** Every model parsed from
an LLM response now treats an explicit null on a *defaulted* field as an
absent key. That is a state the schema already declares legal and production
already exercises constantly. It does **not** apply to required fields (a null
`symbol`, `rating`, `stop_loss` or `sell_price` still rejects the object,
correctly — no default exists to fall back on), and two defaulted fields are
explicitly exempted because their defaults are affirmative instructions rather
than "nothing was said": a position's `direction` (defaults `long` — a null
must never quietly flip a short) and the Risk Manager's `scale_all_buys`
(defaults `1.0` — a null must never quietly release a brake it meant to pull).
The whole-object rules are untouched, so an actionable analysis still cannot
survive without an entry, a stop, a target, a setup type and a structural
level.

**Counting, because recovering it quietly is its own failure.**
`thesis_invalid_if` is the soft-exit signal. Blanking it keeps the analysis
but throws away the trigger that would exit before the hard stop fires, and
nothing anywhere said how often that happened. Two counts now reach the Risk
Manager's prompt and the session log as non-blocking advisories, on the same
seam `data_degraded` and `pm_audit_step_missing` already use:
`analysis_field_nulled` (kept the object, lost an input) and
`analysis_parse_loss` (lost the object entirely). The second one fires even
when a retry later recovers the symbol — the case that was previously
invisible, because `data_status["tech"]` reads "ok" and the only trace was an
INFO line.

**What would catch it next time.** A test that walks every model in
`src/models.py` and fails if one is parsed from LLM output, has a defaulted
field that rejects null, and has not opted into the rule. A new model cannot
reintroduce this by omission — which is the point, because the previous
approach depended on somebody remembering.

### 2026-09-01 — a network blip could silently switch off the sector concentration cap

**In plain words:** when the system couldn't figure out which industry a
stock belongs to, it treated that stock as if the sector limit didn't apply
to it at all. A position already held with the same problem also stopped
counting toward its sector's total. Neither of those showed up anywhere, so
an ordinary network hiccup could switch the concentration cap off for most
of the tradeable list, and nobody would have known.

**The real cause.** A stock's sector comes from a live network lookup; only
the ~21 sector ETFs have an offline backup table. The other 80 of 101
tradeable names have no fallback. When the lookup fails, times out, or a
stock genuinely has no listed sector, it comes back "Unknown" — and the risk
check's sector rule read "Unknown" as "skip this stock entirely," in both
directions: a new trade in an unresolved sector was never measured against
the limit, and a HELD position with an unresolved sector was invisible to
every sector's exposure total. This was a known, deliberately-deferred gap
from the same-day work that raised the sector target to 75% with a hard 90%
wall and split it by long/short side — the code that shipped that change
said so directly in a comment. With margin arriving the same night at up to
2x, an unresolved sector meant, in practice, no concentration limit at all
on a leveraged book.

**What was done.** An unresolved sector is no longer exempt. It is pooled
into its own "Unknown" bucket and checked against the exact same 75%
target / 90% hard wall every real sector gets, for new trades and for
positions already held. Hitting this condition now raises a visible flag:
a plain "degraded: sector" line appears in every session's summary (the
same line already used when the news or macro feed is having a bad day),
and it reaches the AI Risk Manager's review directly. A lookup that timed
out or failed reads differently from a stock that genuinely has no listed
sector — the first should fix itself on the next check, the second likely
won't — and the message says which one happened rather than reading the
same. The 75%/90% numbers themselves were not touched, and an ordinary,
successfully-resolved sector behaves exactly as it did before.

**Not done, and why.** No offline sector table was built for the 80
uncovered names — one that stays correct is its own project, and the point
of this fix is that the cap no longer depends on the lookup succeeding. The
order-sizing pass that pre-shrinks a trade for a crowded sector before it
ever reaches the risk check still does not count an unresolved sector
either — that is separate, unrelated code (fractional order sizing) another
effort owns tonight. Nothing is silently unenforced as a result: the risk
check's hard wall is what actually stops a trade from over-concentrating
regardless of whether it was pre-shrunk, and that wall now sees an
unresolved sector correctly.

### 2026-09-01 morning — the desk judged every trade by dividing a measurement by a guess

**What broke, plainly.** The desk looked at 38 tradeable ideas and placed
nothing. Every idea is scored on how much it could make against how much it
could lose. The "could lose" half was a real number the system measures off
the chart. The "could make" half was a number the AI simply wrote down. Two
thirds of the ideas failed the score before any human-style judgement was
applied at all — including the two the desk was most confident about.

**The real cause.** The score was arithmetic performed on an opinion, and it
failed systematically rather than randomly: a correctly-measured wide stop
divided into a modestly-guessed target misses the threshold as a matter of
arithmetic, whatever the trade is actually worth. **The threshold was not the
defect and was not moved** — lowering a threshold that sits on invented
numbers leaves it sitting on invented numbers.

**What was done.** The "could make" number is now computed from the same
measured chart structure the "could lose" number already came from, or the
trade is refused by name. Six distinct refusal reasons, because "no trade"
with no reason given is what let this survive unnoticed in the first place.
The AI's own guess is kept as evidence and the gap between the two is logged,
but it no longer enters the arithmetic.

**The thing to argue about next is the HOLDING PERIOD, not the threshold.**
The shape of the maths means a trade can only clear the bar if it is given
long enough to get there — roughly 27 sessions for an unstructured target, 12
when aiming at a real level on the chart. Below that the trade cannot pay
1.5:1 however it is judged. This is also why the stop-floor fix shipped the
same night matters: honouring a stop that sits on a real level roughly halves
the required holding period. The two are one fix in two halves.

**Not verified, and nobody should quote it as if it were.** How many of the 38
would now pass is unknown — the per-symbol chart data from that run is not
available offline. The worked example in the tests uses invented chart data;
it shows what the rule does with a plausible chart, not what that stock's
actual chart contained.

**A second defect found while fixing this.** Widening a stop always moved it
to the correct side of the entry price — so a short trade handed a nonsensical
stop came out the other end looking valid, silently repairing the very error
the safety check exists to catch. It now refuses. The test that should have
caught this passed only because its fixture had no volatility reading, which
is not a state production ever reaches.

### 2026-09-01 — the benchmark rig could not spend money; the trading desk was never affected

**In plain words:** three separate things stopped a model test from running.
None of them touched live trading. All three were in the test setup, and all
three were fixed the same afternoon.

**1. The working copy had no credentials file at all.** `AppConfig` refuses to
load when a provider named in `settings.yaml` has no key, so the benchmark
died at startup before any model call. Same failure family as the
`GOOGLE_API_KEY` blocker the day before (below) — and the same fix: a `.env`
holding only `placeholder-managed-by-onecli` values, with the real secrets
injected by the gateway on the way out. **The lesson repeats: a green CI run
says nothing about whether a config will load in the environment that has to
run it.**

**2. The benchmark billed against production's live-trading spend caps.**
`benchmark_models.py` runs inside the real LLM cost circuit, whose limits are
`session_cost_limit_usd: 0.90` and `daily_cost_limit_usd: 2.75`. Those exist to
stop a runaway *trading* session; a deliberate 23-trial benchmark is not that,
and would have tripped the session cap partway through and reported a
misleading partial result. Fixed by running against a benchmark-only config
with raised ceilings and a scratch database, so production's ledger, database
and daily budget are untouched. **Do not raise the production limits to make a
benchmark fit.**

**3. Muting Telegram latched the cost circuit closed.** The circuit treats a
reachable operator as a mandatory precondition for spending anything —
`require_telegram_alerts`, which `config.py` explicitly refuses to let anyone
set false. Setting `TELEGRAM_DISABLED=1` (to stop a benchmark alerting Rex's
phone about a circuit that is not his desk) therefore disabled the notifier,
which marked the circuit unavailable, which blocked all paid analysis. The
correct lever already existed: `QAMC_REHEARSAL=1` keeps the notifier *enabled*
so the precondition is honestly satisfied, while suppressing and logging every
send. Blast radius verified as `src/notifier.py` alone. **This is a good
design working as intended — the fix was to use it correctly, not to weaken
it.**

**Also cleared:** the failed attempt left an emergency-latch sidecar
(`bench.db.llm-circuit-unavailable`) that would have kept the next run blocked.
A latch is sticky by design; clearing it is an explicit operator step.

### 2026-09-01 — GLM 5.2 fails outright roughly one run in three at the PM seat

**In plain words:** a cheap model that looked perfect turned out to produce
nothing usable on one run out of three. When it fails, the portfolio manager
returns no decision at all, so that session places no trades.

Two trials on 2026-08-31 scored 1.00 at $0.055/run and made GLM 5.2 look like
an ~8x cost saving at the most expensive seat. A third trial on 2026-09-01
scored **0.00**: the model ran to `output_tokens: 16000`, hit the `max_tokens`
ceiling exactly, was truncated mid-JSON, and `finish_reason=length`. The
portfolio manager returned a non-JSON response and the whole review was
discarded.

**Ruled out before believing it was the model.** The scenario is a frozen
fixture, not live market data — input was byte-identical across all three runs
(21,033 tokens). `max_tokens: 16000` is a static config value, not fitted from
history, so the empty scratch database did not change it. GLM's own output
length is what varied: 7,219 / 9,071 / 16,000+. The settings comment notes the
16K ceiling was sized to cover "the observed production PM payload (~11K output
tokens)" — GLM runs well past that envelope.

**Why this matters more than the price.** A seat that silently produces nothing
one session in three is worse than an expensive seat that always answers. Cost
per run is the wrong metric on its own; cost per *usable* run is the number.
Two samples said "perfect" and were wrong — this is the argument for repeats.

Status at time of writing: a 10-repeat run is in flight to establish the real
truncation rate. **The seat was NOT moved.** GPT-5.5 remains the portfolio
manager.

### DEPLOYED 2026-08-31 21:20 UTC — and one blocker that tests could not catch

Running at `b88b836`. PRs #202 and #203 both merged, API restarted, served
cockpit bundle matches disk, rehearsal PASS against the deployed code with the
production database byte-identical.

**The blocker worth remembering: `GOOGLE_API_KEY` was not on the box.** Seven
seats now declare `provider: google`, and `_check_llm_provider_keys` refuses to
load a config whose in-use provider has no key. Not degraded — the desk would
not have STARTED, and the first symptom at 09:30 would have been silence. Every
test passed and both PRs were green; the thing that would have broken lived
entirely outside the repo. Fixed by adding
`GOOGLE_API_KEY=placeholder-managed-by-onecli` (same convention as
OPENROUTER_API_KEY — the real credential is injected by the gateway on the way
out; .env only needs it non-empty). Original .env backed up to
`/home/qamc/.env.bak-2026-08-31`, OUTSIDE the repo so it cannot read as drift.
**Generalise this: after any change to which providers the seats use, load the
config ON THE BOX before trusting a green CI run.**

**Proven live, not assumed.** A forced evening session ran on the new routing at
21:29 UTC: `evening_analyst` on `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`, 20,642 tokens, **cost
$0.00**, status `analyzed`. The free tier works end to end through the gateway,
and the $0.00 pricing row settles correctly rather than reading as unknown. The
two new alert lines were also confirmed rendering from the box.

**Runway.** OpenRouter is prepaid: $32.09 left, per-key cap removed. A CLEAN
day costs $1.02 (2026-08-27 — the only day that week where all six sessions ran
and the morning completed first time). Never estimate from an average of recent
days: they are cheap precisely because the desk kept crashing early.

### 2026-08-31 evening — the reward:risk gate was being narrated, not computed

**Two forced sessions rejected every trade. Neither rejection was a judgement
call; both were the deterministic constructor and the LLM Risk Manager
disagreeing about facts the RM should never have been asked to derive.**

- **The RM was doing the arithmetic its own gate is judged on.** It receives
  the constructed order as bare Entry/Stop/Target text with no ratio. For a
  BUY on RSG it computed the ratio TWICE IN ONE RESPONSE — `rr_audit` said
  "R/R = 1.65 ... above 1.5, so compliant", `reasoning` said "R/R = 1.31,
  which is below the 1.5 floor" and rejected. The pipeline acts on
  `reasoning`. 1.65 is right; 1.31 matches no combination of the inputs.
  `TradeDecision.reward_risk` is now a Python computed field, mirroring
  `TechAnalysisResult.risk_reward` and its "not trusted to the LLM" rule,
  rendered into the prompt and declared authoritative there. PR #202.
- **The constructor removed trades without telling anyone.** It struck NVDA on
  the reward:risk floor; PM's narrative — written BEFORE construction and
  rendered verbatim — still argued for it, so the RM vetoed the whole plan
  ("While COP and V are valid, the plan as presented is not internally
  consistent"). Two valid trades died for a bookkeeping mismatch.
  `PortfolioDecision.constructor_dropped` now carries removals into the
  prompt. Same pattern as the existing `cap_note`, whose own comment records
  the identical failure from 2026-08-20 — solved once for allocation caps,
  never extended to removals. PR #202.
- **Ten new tests over the constructor→RM handoff, which had none.** No test
  anywhere built a widened-stop order and asserted what the RM prompt shows
  for it. That is exactly the seam both defects lived in.

**Three grandfathered stops widened to the noise-band floor.** V, DIS and
CMCSA were opened 2026-08-27 13:36 UTC; `min_stop_atr_multiple = 3.0` was
committed the same day at 22:28 UTC, after the close, so they were never
subject to it. Measured 2026-08-31 they sat at 1.02x / 1.03x / 1.62x ATR —
inside a single ordinary day's range for the first two. Widened via
`broker.replace_stop_loss(..., allow_lowering=True)`, the same supported path
the ex-dividend adjustment uses, NOT a hand edit: it snapshots and rolls back
on failure and leaves no unprotected window for the ~30-min coverage
reconciler to "repair" by reinstating the original tight stop. MSFT was left
alone — its live stop had already trailed up to 485.10 and is correct against
current price, not the 480.30 the entry row still records.

**The ledger was corrected, on owner instruction, and the tool has no path for
it.** Recorded spend went 2.1741 -> 0.2494, the exact sum of `agent_logs`
provider-reported costs for the ET day. `scripts/cost_circuit.py` only ever
clears latches and promises never to erase settled spend, so this was a direct
row edit. **Editing `llm_budget_days` alone raises an emergency latch** — a
hard check joins it to `llm_budget_sessions` and `llm_budget_reservations`
(`cost_circuit.py:1216-1247`) and both ledgers must move in one transaction.
Learned by tripping it. Prior row backed up to
`data/ledger_backup_2026-08-31.json`; caps unchanged.

**STILL UNRESOLVED — do not let anyone tell you this is closed.** Whether a
real OpenRouter rate-limit reaches `_is_known_zero_cost_failure` carrying
`status_code = 429` is UNVERIFIED. Reading the allow-list is not proof. The
rehearsal rig cannot settle it either: `ops/rehearsal/faults.py` builds its
`RateLimited` fault with a hard-coded `status_code = 429`, so it encodes the
assumption in doubt and can only ever confirm it. Settling this needs a
captured real rate-limit, or a classifier robust to both shapes.

### DONE 2026-08-31 — primary moved to Gemini direct, OpenRouter to backup

**Shipped as PR #203.** Seven specialist seats run `provider: google` /
`gemini-3.5-flash-lite` on the AI Studio free tier; OpenRouter carries the
same model as a paid backup, so a failover changes the road and not the
reasoning. The failover target is configuration now, not the hard-coded
`claude-opus-4-7` — an inherited remnant at ~50x the primary's price that had
never once completed, because no Anthropic credential was ever configured.
Measured limits, endpoint verification and rates are in the code comments and
PR #203; not restated here.

**Three things that are still open, and only these:**

- **`position_reviewer` was deliberately NOT migrated.** It is a decision seat
  and `test_decision_seats_run_a_model_measured_at_that_seat` demands a model
  measured at its own scenario. No benchmark exists for 3.5 at `midday_exit`,
  and none can be produced against the 2.5 incumbent because Google refuses
  2.5 to new keys. It moves after
  `ops/model_policy/benchmark_models.py --scenario midday_exit --models gemini-3.5-flash-lite`
  is run and committed.
- **`ops/commissioning/verify_commissioning.py` carries stale
  `EXPECTED_PROVIDER` / `EXPECTED_ROUTING` constants** and will report FAIL
  against the new routing. Its own tests do not catch this because they
  self-reference the same constants instead of reading `settings.yaml`.
- **This saves ~7% of spend, not the bill.** Measured from `agent_logs` over
  7 days: `openai/gpt-5.5` (portfolio_manager) is $6.64 of a ~$7.16 week — 93%
  of spend on 21% of calls. The eight Gemini seats are $0.51 between them. The
  cost ledger remains, almost entirely, a guard on the PM seat. The real lever
  there is input size and prompt caching, NOT a weaker model — the owner has
  ruled that out and is right to.
### 2026-08-31, afternoon — charged $0.62 for calls that cost nothing

**The rate limit did not stop trading. The phantom bill for it did.**

A logical call can attempt several DIFFERENT providers, and `BaseAgent.run()`
re-raises the PRIMARY error while discarding whatever the failover hit. The
cost circuit judged "did this cost anything" from that single exception — so a
failover rejected **401** (which by definition billed nothing, and which the
zero-cost allow-list already covers) was invisible to it, and the whole call
was charged its conservative reserve at the **failover model's** dearer price.

Observed live at 12:36 ET: `news_analyst` refused 429 upstream, refused again,
then 401 from the failover for want of an Anthropic credential. Real cost
**$0.00**. Charged **$0.6159**. The unexplained spend tripped
`failed_call_unknown_cost` and latched the desk — for the third time that day,
and on the same underlying pattern as the 09:32 shutdown.

**Fixed:** every attempt's failure is now carried to the circuit, and a call
is treated as free only when **every** attempt is provably free. The rule gets
STRICTER, not looser — one ambiguous attempt (a cut stream, an unclassified
error, a 5xx after generation may have started) and the whole reservation is
charged exactly as before. A call is only known to have cost nothing when
nothing it did could have cost anything. Callers that cannot enumerate their
attempts keep the old single-exception behaviour, so this can only ever
recognise more genuinely-free failures, never fewer.

**And an unknown turned into a measurement.** When a call IS charged, the
shapes of every attempt are now logged — exception type, status code, and
which one made it chargeable. The remaining open question is whether
OpenRouter's "temporarily rate-limited upstream" arrives with a status the
allow-list carries; it could not be settled by reasoning and deliberately was
not settled by hammering the provider to reproduce it. The next occurrence
will say.

### 2026-08-31, afternoon — why the provider was refusing us, and the fix

**The owner's framing, and it was the right one: never discover a limit by
hitting it.** Every request costs money, so the work of sizing one belongs on
our side of the wire. That rules out both obvious designs — a rate ceiling
that backs off when it trips, and a ceiling that learns from refusals — because
each pays the provider for the lesson.

**What was actually happening.** Every one of the eleven rate limits in three
weeks of logs hit the **same agent**, the Technical Analyst, and no other agent
was declined once. It is the only one that bursts: ~314,000 tokens inside 80
seconds, ~252,000 per minute, against 20-30k for everything else. Not market-open
congestion — the refusals land at 10:01, 10:30, 11:31 on other days. And
OpenRouter's own message says why: *"add your own key to accumulate your rate
limits"* — we share its pooled Google credentials, so other customers' traffic
counts against us.

Nothing bounded the burst. Concurrency was capped at three requests and context
was capped per call, but a rate limit counts **tokens per minute**, and three
concurrent 80,000-token requests clear both caps while being exactly what gets
refused.

**Three things were wrong, all measurable:**

1. **72% of the payload was raw price bars, and half of that was noise.** Bars
   were serialised at full float64 precision — `O=14.920000076293945` for a
   stock that traded at $14.92. Those digits are float32-to-float64 conversion
   artefacts, not price data; the source could not represent them. Rendering at
   six significant figures cuts the payload 30% and loses nothing.
2. **The batch split was a fixed count calibrated against a stale assumption.**
   `_CHUNK_SIZE = 25` was set against "~300 input tokens per symbol". The bar
   window grew from 20 to 40, per-symbol context was added, and the real figure
   became ~3,600. Nothing failed loudly, because context length was never the
   binding constraint — the model takes a million tokens. **A count cannot bound
   tokens.**
3. **Relative-strength context depended on how the batch was split.** The index
   ETFs sit at the top of the universe, so only the first chunk ever contained
   SPY; every symbol after it silently lost its benchmark. Which symbols kept it
   was a function of the chunk size.

**The fix — build to a budget, not to a count.** Requests are packed until the
next symbol would exceed a token budget, then a new request starts. An oversized
request is not unlikely, it is unreachable: nothing is added to a full batch.
The bytes-to-tokens conversion comes from a model fitted to each agent's own
past calls — data already paid for, so measuring costs nothing and improves as
the desk runs. It never learns from a refusal.

The model is two parameters, and both are physically real:

    tokens = fixed_tokens + tokens_per_byte x content_bytes

    tech_analyst        4,127 tok + 0.939 tok/byte
    news_analyst        4,200 tok + 0.227 tok/byte
    portfolio_manager  12,483 tok + 0.214 tok/byte

The intercepts recover each agent's system prompt (tech_analyst's is 19,792
bytes of prose; 19,792/4,127 = 4.8 bytes per token, exactly what English
tokenizes at). The slopes recover the content: ~1.07 bytes/token for dense OHLCV
digits, ~4.4 for prose. Median prediction error 0.9-4.3%. A single
bytes-per-token ratio cannot express this — it folds a per-request constant into
a per-byte rate, so it is right at only one message size, and tech_analyst's
messages span 6KB to 379KB.

**Measured on 53 real production symbol sections:**

| | requests | peak request | total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| before | 3 | 136,449 tok | 290,329 tok |
| trim only | 3 | 96,135 tok | 205,833 tok |
| **trim + 45k budget** | **5** | **44,654 tok** | **214,087 tok** |

**Peak down 67%, total down 26%** — both directions improve, because the trim
more than pays for the extra repeated system prompts. Worst case with all three
concurrent slots full is ~134k/min, against the ~252k/min that was being refused.

**And the repeated system prompts may be free anyway.** This seat's route bills
a cached prompt token at $0.01/M against $0.10/M — a 10x discount that decides
the trade-off outright. Nobody knew whether it was happening because nothing
read the field. Cache hits are now logged; the answer arrives with the next
session's logs.

**Why 45,000 and not something else.** It is where the curve knees: 60k saves 2%
of total tokens for a 33% higher peak, 100k saves 4% for a peak nearly three
times larger. Overridable with `QUANT_AGENT_TECH_REQUEST_TOKENS`.

**A tokens-per-minute governor exists but is a BACKSTOP, not the control.** It
cannot fire in normal operation now — the packer cannot emit a burst that large.
It is there for what the budget cannot see (a new agent, a prompt that grows, a
retry storm) and it reports at CRITICAL if it ever engages, because that would
mean something grew.

**Failure posture, deliberately.** Nothing in the sizing path may take a session
down: every entry point catches broadly and degrades to the old fixed split. An
efficiency measure that can stop a trading desk is a bad trade — which is the
whole lesson of the morning recorded below.

**Left open, owner's call:** our own Google key (a free tier exists, and Google
serves the *same* Gemini model directly, so it is a same-model backup with no
consistency problem at all); and whether to pin a cheaper route — the identical
model is served by five endpoints, one at half our current price.

**Not the cause, and a correction to an earlier note in this file:** the
reservation estimator's conservatism was reported here as 6.8x. That was an
apples-to-oranges comparison of morning estimates against intra-day actuals.
Measured like-for-like across ten runs it is **1.49x**, which is roughly what a
deliberately conservative reserve should look like. It contributed to the
2026-08-28 ceiling trip; it is not the pattern, and it has not been changed.

### 2026-08-31, market open — the desk went dark two minutes after the bell

**Closed by `fix/provider-failover-attempt-budget`. Read this before touching
the retry, failover or cost-circuit code.**

What happened: at 09:32 ET, two minutes after the open, the morning session
stopped with `paid_analysis_suspended` and every session after it no-opped.
Spend at the moment it stopped: **$0.05 of a $2.75 day.** It required a
manual operator reset, so the desk stayed dark until a human noticed.

The cause was an arithmetic contradiction between two settings that lived in
different files and were never compared:

| | value | where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| attempts the retry loop can spend on one call | 3 (two primary + one failover) | `_max_retries()` in code, env-overridable |
| attempts the cost circuit permitted per call | 2 | `config/settings.yaml` |

So **cross-provider failover could never once complete.** Every failover was
attempt three against a ceiling of two. It only ever mattered when the
primary provider failed — which is the one situation failover exists for —
and on 2026-08-31 an upstream rate-limit on the cheap primary finally
produced it. The same family of limit had tripped on 08-26, 08-27 and twice
on 08-28; each time a different number was raised and this one was not
touched.

Making it worse, `provider_attempt_limit` was the only trigger of its family
still wired to the durable operator-reset latch. Its strictly WIDER sibling,
`session_retry_attempt_limit`, was already correctly scoped to the session.
Nothing chose that: unrecognised codes default to a hard latch.

What changed:

1. **The ceiling is derived, not typed.** `provider_attempt_budget()` in
   `src/agents/base.py` owns the arithmetic, next to the loop that actually
   spends the attempts. `config/settings.yaml` no longer pins it.
2. **Disagreement is now a startup failure.** `AppConfig` refuses to load a
   ceiling below the loop's worst case, naming both settings. It fails on
   the ground instead of at 09:32 on a Monday.
3. **`provider_attempt_limit` holds the session instead of latching the
   desk**, matching its sibling.

**Why a weekend of testing and auditing missed it, and the thing actually
worth remembering:** the suite had thorough failover tests AND thorough
circuit tests, and every one of them passed throughout. `tests/conftest.py`
sets `_allow_unmetered_for_tests = True` for the whole suite, so the failover
tests ran with **no cost circuit attached at all**, and the circuit tests ran
with no failover. Nothing anywhere ran the two together — which is precisely
where they contradicted each other. Two well-tested halves, an untested seam.
`tests/test_provider_attempt_budget.py` now attaches a real breaker to a real
agent and fails the primary for real reasons.

**And the rehearsal rig could not have caught it either**, which is why it
now can — see the fault-injection note above. Every recorded response it
replays is a response that succeeded, so the failure branch was unreachable
offline. It was reachable only by waiting for the market.

**A second defect this one was hiding, found by deploying it (same day):**
`fail_call` stamps the ET day's accounting inexact when it charges a
conservative reserve for a request whose true cost it never learned, and
nothing clears that flag within the day — it lifts only when the next ET day
seeds a fresh row. The quota reconciler refuses to rearm over an inexact day,
by design. Those two facts had never met, because an inexact day always came
with a hard latch and the reconciler returns early whenever one is set. **The
latch was masking the refusal.** Scoping `provider_attempt_limit` to the
session removed the mask, and the live desk went straight from "suspended" to
"every session start raises, and no operator action can clear it until
midnight". A crash loop is a worse failure than the suspension it replaced.

Fixed by letting an operator reset clear an inexact day, with the same
mandatory audited reason. It clears only the *we-could-not-prove-this-figure*
flag; the recorded amount is left exactly as it stands, conservative reserve
included, because that over-states cost rather than under-stating it and
`scripts/cost_circuit.py` promises reset never erases settled spend. Judging a
conservative figure good enough to continue on is an operator's call;
recomputing what the provider really charged is not something the code can
honestly do.

**The one underneath both of those — the real cause of the pattern (found
10:36 ET on the live desk, while verifying the fix):** the quota reconciler
runs on **every** paid call, and it refused to proceed whenever the current
ET day's accounting was inexact — even when it had nothing to do. Its
exactness precondition guards exactly one operation: releasing a hold carried
over from an *earlier* day. The check sat before the query that finds those
holds, so it fired when there were none.

`fail_call` stamps the day inexact whenever it charges a conservative reserve
for a request whose true cost it never learned. So **the first failed request
of any day poisoned every paid call after it** — the refusal reads as the
circuit's own infrastructure failing, which writes the emergency latch and
stops the desk until an operator clears it.

One rate-limited request, and the trading day was over. **That is the
2026-08-26 / 08-27 / 08-28 / 08-31 pattern**, and it survived four rounds of
raising limits because nobody was looking at the reconciler: the hard latches
masked it, since it returns early whenever one is set. Removing the last mask
is what finally showed it — as a crash rather than a suspension, which is
worse, and which is why it was found within minutes of deploying instead of
next Monday.

Fixed by restoring the check to what it protects: no cross-day hold, nothing
to rearm, nothing to be exact about. The safety property is unchanged and
pinned by its own test — rearming yesterday's stop on unproven books is still
refused.

**Two things deliberately left for the owner, not fixed here:**

- **The backup model costs ~50x the primary.** Primary is
  `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite` at $0.10/$0.40 per million tokens; the
  failover target is hard-coded to `claude-opus-4-7` at $5.00/$25.00. For
  the Technical Analyst's ~150k-token prompt that is ~$0.02 versus ~$0.95 —
  against a $0.90 per-session cap. So a failover on the biggest agent now
  completes and delivers its analysis, then immediately holds the session on
  cost, which can starve the Portfolio Manager that runs after it. Better
  than a dead desk, but not a full rescue. A backup priced near the primary
  would be; `_FALLBACK_MODEL` is a module constant with no config knob.
  Model strategy is TABLED pending a clean spend re-measure, so this is
  recorded, not changed.
- **`fail_call` still charges for a request the circuit itself refused to
  send.** A blocked attempt is provably $0 — no bytes left the process — but
  the reservation covers the whole call, and earlier attempts on that same
  call may have burned tokens nobody was told about. Marking it zero-cost
  would risk under-counting real spend, which on a system that trades money
  is the worse error. It no longer fires on this failure mode (with the
  ceiling correct the failover simply succeeds), so what reaches it is a
  genuine attempt runaway — arguably a thing an operator should look at.
  Asserted explicitly in `test_cost_circuit.py` rather than glossed.

## 2026-09-02 — the rehearsal rig's verdict was a coin flip

**The pre-deploy gate has been giving PASS or FAIL on the same code depending
on which recorded responses it happened to draw. A green light from it meant
less than anyone believed.**

Found while gating the 2026-09-01 ship. The merged tip returned FAIL where the
starting commit returned PASS, so the merges were bisected one at a time with
the rig, each checkout verified clean before running.

Bisect result: the flip appeared at `b8d5986`, the fix that stopped a null
`thesis_invalid_if` binning an entire technical analysis. That fix is
demonstrably correct — it eliminated all 10 parse failures in the run and
recovered 2 more symbols.

**Then the variable was controlled.** With `--replay-run` pinned to a single
recorded session, BOTH commits FAIL identically, and the fix reduces rejections
from 23 to 21. Unpinned, the rig draws on ALL recorded responses; any change to
how many analyses parse consumes that shared pool differently, a different
recorded PM decision gets replayed, and the grounding check then compares that
decision against a session whose analyst coverage does not match it. The
verdict tracks pool consumption, not correctness.

Symptom to recognise: `pm_grounding_error` naming a symbol that is NOT in the
tech batch's unresolved list — on 2026-09-02 it was `ZS`, a real target from
the previous afternoon's session, replayed into a morning that never analysed
it.

**What this means for anyone using the rig as a gate:**
- An unpinned PASS is not evidence. Two runs of the same code can differ.
- The rig CANNOT return PASS on this scenario in any state, because it cannot
  reproduce full analyst coverage offline. That is a gap in the gate, not in
  the code — see "what is still not fixed" below.
- This is the same family as the already-recorded limitation that the rig
  cannot validate a prompt change. Both come from replaying recorded answers
  into a session that no longer matches them.

### Fixed the next day (2026-09-02)

**The replay is pinned by default.** Omitting `--replay-run` no longer means
"draw on all history"; it now means "the most recent COMPLETE recorded run of
this session type that had already started by `--as-of`", chosen by
`select_replay_run` in `ops/rehearsal/replay.py` and **printed under the
verdict** so a reader knows what was compared. The verdict is now a function
of (code, session, `--as-of`, database) and nothing else. `--replay-run <id>`
still overrides; `--replay-run any` asks for the old pool-wide behaviour
deliberately and says in the report that the result is not reproducible.

Reproduced end to end rather than asserted, on the two commits that
disagreed, with the same unpinned invocation both times and the checkout
verified clean inside the runner script:

| commit | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `af266de` | **PASS**, 22 rejections | **FAIL**, 23 rejections |
| `0bbb69c` | **FAIL** (`ZS`), 21 rejections | **FAIL**, 21 rejections |

Both now auto-pin to `run-64290730` and fail identically on
`NVDA: claims earnings coverage that does not exist`. The 23 → 21 improvement
that used to read as a PASS → FAIL regression now reads as what it is.

**A third verdict exists: INCONCLUSIVE.** A replay-coverage mismatch used to
be printed exactly like a real defect, which is how a red gate got argued
about for an hour instead of believed or dismissed. `_replay_fidelity`
(`ops/rehearsal/report.py`) now separates them, and is deliberately narrow —
it downgrades only when BOTH hold: the answer replayed for the portfolio
manager came from a different recorded run than the analysts' answers (a
mechanical fact, and impossible under a pin — so a pinned run can never be
downgraded), AND the failure names a symbol this session never analysed,
never rejected and does not hold. Either alone stays FAIL. A hallucinated
ticker in a faithfully replayed session is still the defect it is. Exit codes
are now PASS 0, FAIL 1, INCONCLUSIVE 2.

**The report states its own coverage next to the verdict**, not in the log:
"INCOMPLETE ANALYST COVERAGE: 20 of 56 symbol(s) never got a technical
analysis in this rehearsal ... Do not read it as 'the session was fully
exercised'", plus a one-line summary of how far the replayed prompts have
drifted from the recorded ones (worst overlap 23% on the news seat, 42% on
the portfolio manager, on both commits above).

**What is still not fixed, and is the more important half.** Pinning makes
the gate honest, not useful. A pinned morning rehearsal still cannot PASS,
and the reason is not the code: offline, `macro` and `news` fail outright,
`smart_money` is degraded and `tech` is partial, so the session reaching the
decision stage is not the session the recorded portfolio-manager answer was
grounded in. That answer legitimately cites evidence the rehearsed session
does not have, and the grounding gate correctly throws it out. **The rig can
therefore tell you a morning got worse; it cannot yet tell you a morning is
well.** Nothing in this fix changes that, and the conservative choice was
made deliberately: that failure reports FAIL, not INCONCLUSIVE, because it
does not meet the two-part test above.


## Archive — work completed before 2026-09-01

Moved out of `docs/WORK.md` on 2026-09-01 under the rule at the top of that
file: **finished work is moved here, never deleted.** WORK.md is capped and
loaded into context every session, so it must hold only what is still to be
done.

Every claim below was checked against `gh`/`git` and against the production
checkout before being moved — all 20 PRs cited are genuinely merged AND
deployed (production HEAD matched `origin/main` at the time of the check).
Four claims did NOT survive that check and are corrected inline where they
appear; they are listed here so the corrections are not buried:

1. **Phase 9 (the research desk deliberates) was listed as the FIRST pending
   item.** It is done: §9.1/9.2 shipped as PR #153 and §9.3/9.4 as PR #160,
   both deployed. Only §9.5 (the conviction ledger) is partial, and that was
   never named in the item.
2. **"Insider filter — PR #133 not yet merged/deployed."** Merged 2026-08-29
   and deployed. WORK.md already contradicted itself on this two hundred
   lines further down.
3. **"Inverse-ETF retirement still outstanding."** Obsolete rather than
   undone — the owner reversed this on 2026-08-30 and the inverse ETFs stay.
   `SH`/`SDS`/`PSQ`/`SQQQ` remain in the universe deliberately.
4. **"26 unmerged branches await triage."** The remote now carries 5
   non-main branches. The VPS security branch named there no longer exists;
   its salvageable content was rescued as PR #143.

Text below is moved verbatim. Where an entry contains its own later
correction, both the original claim and the correction are preserved — that
pairing is the record.

**Landed (2026-08-31) — six PRs, all merged and deployed. Nine open defects closed, four more deleted, six new ones found — read this first**

Tonight's audit worked through the thirteen open defects recorded below on 2026-08-30. Full detail and re-check commands for every item are in `docs/phases.yaml`'s `open_defects` entry — this is the plain-language summary.

- The macro event calendar is now half-real. The desk fetches a genuine forward schedule of seven US macro releases (CPI, payrolls, PPI, PCE, GDP, retail sales, jobless claims) from a free government source and shows it to the Risk Manager and the Macro Analyst, and the earnings-date lookup that existed but was never called is now wired in. **Still missing: Fed meeting dates specifically.** No free source publishes those, so both prompts now say so outright instead of guessing. Whether to add the Fed's own free calendar page just for that has been put to the owner — **not yet decided.**
- The price-list refresh gap is closed. A scheduled job now refreshes it twice a day, every day including weekends, and pages over Telegram the moment it starts going stale rather than waiting for the hard cutoff. (Correction to an earlier note: the claim that the box had no scheduled jobs at all was a checking mistake, not a real finding — the box has always had them. The refresh gap itself was real and is now fixed.)
- The evening report's lessons and reminders now actually carry forward: they're saved and read back by tomorrow's trading decisions instead of being generated and thrown away. One of the four fields — the report grading its own prior forecast — is kept for the record but deliberately not fed back in, to avoid the same self-review loop that was cut once before.
- A smaller inconsistency is fixed: the parked cash-equivalent holding can no longer take up one of the limited slots meant for real positions' news coverage.
- Every trade's conviction, requested risk, allocated risk and which model decided it are now visible on the dashboard and through the API, not just recorded internally.
- The rehearsal tool used to test changes offline no longer depends on how stale the live price list happens to be at the moment someone runs it — that dependency mismatched what it was supposed to be testing and could produce a false failure.
- A safety-net test that was supposed to guarantee every outcome prints a plain explanation, but only ever checked itself against itself, has been rebuilt to check against the real code instead. It already found one genuine, small gap in the process (see below).
- Three previously-identical "nothing happened" outcomes inside the mid-day quick check (feature off, already running, nothing found) now report distinctly, so they can be told apart after the fact. All three are and remain harmless.
- Four pieces of dead code confirmed to have zero callers anywhere, including tests, were deleted: an unused local copy of the holdings list, a write-only bookkeeping field, a superseded internal data shape, and four small orphaned helper functions.

**Landed (2026-08-31, later) — two of the items below were fixed the same night**

- Fed meeting dates are no longer a gap. The Federal Reserve publishes its own
  meeting calendar free and the desk now reads it. A second source covers the
  years the machine-readable feed does not reach — without it the desk would
  have confidently reported "no meeting" for dates it simply could not see.
  "No meeting is scheduled" now prints only when a real schedule genuinely
  covers the window asked about; every other case says so in words.
- The alarm that tells the owner a change never reached the live server can
  now actually send. It never could: the credentials were never wired into it,
  so an alert would have gone to a log file and nobody. It has a probe that
  proves the channel still works rather than assuming it.
  **Not finished:** the accompanying scheduled jobs are written but were
  deliberately NOT switched on. They implement a weekly confirmation the owner
  rejected — a week of undetected silence is not monitoring. The replacement,
  where every trading session proves the alert path as part of its own run, was
  unfinished when this was written and has since merged — see below.

**Closed (2026-08-31, later still):**

- The mid-day failure outcome that would have shown a raw internal code now
  explains itself in plain English. The safety-net test that found it is back
  to tracking nothing, which is the state it is meant to be kept in — anything
  parked in it is a defect deferred in writing.
- The offline rehearsal tool no longer misreports how much slack the price-list
  safeguard has. **This was recorded as cosmetic and it was not.** It was
  checked before the setting was available, so it always read "none" — which
  meant the tool told the reader the desk would refuse to run any paid analysis
  in exactly the situation where the desk would in fact have run normally. The
  opposite verdict, not a wrong number. The silent guess that hid it is now a
  hard stop: asked before it can know, the tool refuses to answer rather than
  making something up.
- The scheduled job that pointed at a folder from the project's original owner
  is corrected and merged. It was never wrong on the live server — only in the
  repository's own copy, which meant installing that copy would have broken the
  daily report on contact. Confirmed against the running server, not just the
  merge: the job runs from the right folder and its last run sent the report
  as normal.
- The setup guide one internal file pointed readers at, and that never
  existed, is no longer promised. The reference was removed rather than
  writing a guide — the module it points at already documents itself in
  full, and a second document would only have restated it.
- Full wire-service news coverage is formally closed, not merely unchanged:
  the owner has declined the paid subscription it would need. Free coverage
  stays as already widened.

**Both pull requests noted here as unfinished have since merged:** every one of
the server's startup files is now under version control with an automatic daily
check that reports any difference between the server and the repository; and
the alert-path rework landed, making the trading sessions themselves the
alert-channel watchdog and retiring the weekly digest the owner rejected.

**Landed (2026-08-30, later) — two fixes plus a close call, all deployed**

- The macro data feed's retry policy has been rebuilt. The old one gave a failing economic-data series one quick second try and then gave up; that is exactly what let one bad three-minute stretch (2026-08-26) lose all nine numbers the macro seat reads, silently. It now tries harder, with a real time limit on the whole job — a minute and a half, not per series — so a slow patch can be ridden out without ever risking a session running long. Six new free indicators were added on top of what was already tracked — a real (inflation-adjusted) 10-year yield, the market's inflation expectation, a 3-month Treasury rate, the dollar's strength against other currencies, investment-grade borrowing costs, and weekly unemployment claims — each checked against the real data source before being wired in. And if any of these numbers fail to come back, the desk is now told so directly, the same way it is already told when the news feed is degraded, instead of quietly reasoning from nothing (PR #162).
- A second, smaller repair: if the mid-day opportunity scan crashed partway through, it used to look exactly like a normal quiet check that found nothing — no error, no signal, nothing for anyone to see. It now says plainly that it crashed, and the rehearsal report counts that as a failure instead of a pass (PR #163).
- A close call, caught in time: the price list the spending safeguard uses to know what each AI call costs is supposed to refresh itself, but only when a real trading session actually starts one — nothing refreshes it on a clock. Over the weekend it sat unrefreshed long enough to cross the point where the safeguard would have refused to run any paid analysis at all come Monday morning, meaning the desk would have opened and done nothing. It was noticed and refreshed by hand before that happened. (Closed: PR #168 added a systemd timer that refreshes the price list twice a day, seven days a week — see the 2026-08-31 entry above.)
- Still missing on the macro side: there is no calendar of upcoming Fed decisions or inflation reports. Asked whether one is coming up, the desk still answers from what the model remembers, not from a real schedule.

**Found (2026-08-30, documentation audit) — ten more open defects recorded, none fixed yet**

An audit raised eleven candidate defects beyond the two already tracked above; ten verified real, one turned out false. All ten are now recorded in `docs/phases.yaml`'s `open_defects` entry as items (c) through (m), ranked by how directly each touches a trading or risk decision — read that entry for the full detail and the exact re-check command for each. In order: (c) the earnings-date lookup meant to ground the risk manager's mandatory event-risk check is wired to nothing, so that check still runs on the model's memory instead of real data; (d) the evening report's discipline-notes / selection-rules / thesis-update / outlook-grading fields are generated by the LLM every night and dropped before they reach storage or any later decision, so the loop the evening report explicitly promises never closes; (e) the evening session excludes the parked cash-sweep vehicle from per-symbol news selection but the two same-day checks earlier in the day don't, so it can occupy one of the capped news slots that would otherwise go to a real position; (f) every trade's conviction / requested-risk / allocated-risk / deciding-model fields are persisted but not exposed anywhere a human can see them, dashboard or API; (g) the rehearsal harness's own test that proves it can reproduce last week's spending-limit failure is quietly coupled to the same OpenRouter pricing-cache staleness already recorded as defect (b) above, so it can fail for a reason unrelated to what it exists to test; (h) a test meant to guarantee every outcome of the mid-day quick check prints a plain explanation is not actually exhaustive — it only checks that its own checklist agrees with itself — though it does not currently fail; (i) several healthy outcomes of the intraday opportunity scan (feature off, lock contention, nothing found) are indistinguishable from each other after the fact (benign, a residual loose end from this month's crash-visibility fix, PR #163); (j)-(m) are lower-consequence dead code found in the same pass: an unused local positions table nothing in production reads, a run-context field written once and never read back, a superseded news-analysis model family kept alive only by tests, and four small helper functions with zero callers anywhere.

**Checked and found NOT to be a defect:** a claim that `docs/STATE.md` pins a specific production commit that is now several merges behind current `main`. Verified live 2026-08-30: production HEAD and `origin/main` are both `6a8694a` — zero merges of gap (`scripts/status_board.py`'s own live `undeployed_merges` reading is 0). Not recorded as a defect.

**Separately noticed while checking the above:** `docs/STATE.md`'s "Intraday opportunity discovery" section — the file was dated 2026-08-27 at the top at the time — still said the broker layer has no short-selling capability at all today, and that nothing in the codebase tells the Portfolio Manager the inverse ETFs are bearish instruments. Both were false: shorting went live 2026-08-29, and the inverse-ETF/Portfolio-Manager wiring landed 2026-08-30 (PR #158). Flagged here rather than fixed in the moment — and fixed twelve minutes later anyway, in commit `4fb02e47`, which corrected both claims in place with dated notes.

**Landed (2026-08-30 through ~15:00 UTC 2026-08-31) — all five items now deployed to production**

- All five ordered items from the 2026-08-29 backlog have shipped. (1) Inverse-ETF longs now count against the bearish exposure ceiling, with a second commit fixing a sign error: shorting an inverse ETF is bullish, not bearish (PR #158). (2) Free per-symbol news feeds are scoped to held positions and candidates instead of universally requested (PR #157). (3) Every trade carries its allocation, conviction, and deciding model pinned at entry; exits label whether they link to an originating decision (PR #159). (4) The rehearsal harness can now read the intraday scan's own outcome report instead of only the top-level status — at the time, one limitation was left in place on purpose: a crashed scan produced no marker, so the session status stayed 'ok' even on crash (production honesty gap, documented but not fixed by design) (PR #156). That gap is now closed too — see "Landed (2026-08-30, later)" above (PR #163): a crash now attaches its own status and reports as a failure. The other limitation from PR #156 still holds: the nested-outcome path is unit-tested but no production replay has actually contained an intraday scan yet (none in live history so far). (5) The desk can now formally argue out disagreements and size trade risk by the number of independent seats that agree: a target carrying an unadjudicated conflict is dropped before grounding (punishment fits offence, single-target drop not session-wide), and risk_allocation_pct is ceilinged by agreement count in the deterministic risk code (PR #160, merged during this audit window).
- To check the live state: `sudo -n -u qamc git -C /home/qamc/quant-agent log --oneline -1` should show PR #160 merged.

**Landed (2026-08-29) — read this first, supersedes most of what follows**

- Short selling is complete and live: the desk can now open a short and cover
  it, not merely hold one safely, on the same careful caps and gates a long
  trade gets.
- A tool to test a strategy change against real history now exists, though it
  can only check the mechanical trading rules, not what the AI agents
  themselves would have decided — that was never recorded, so it cannot be
  replayed.
- Any research seat, not only the chart analyst, can now bring a candidate to
  the desk's attention. Still missing: the desk formally arguing out a
  disagreement between seats, and sizing a trade bigger when more seats
  independently agree.
- The cost-circuit outage from two days ago is fully fixed, not just
  patched, and its safety backstop now recovers on its own instead of
  shutting a trading mode down for the rest of the day.
- Both defects logged below that were specific to short trades — blind
  performance stats and confused crash recovery — are verified fixed.
- The news desk's free source list was widened, and a feed that had quietly
  stopped publishing while still reporting success was found and removed.
  Real wire-service coverage still needs a paid subscription and an owner
  decision.
- All of the above is merged and confirmed deployed to production as of
  today. Most of "STILL OPEN — 2026-08-29" and "EXECUTION ORDER FOR THE NEXT
  SESSION" below is now done; see their own superseded-notices rather than
  reading them as current.

Five items, ordered by dependency then value:

1. **DONE (PR #158)** — Make the inverse funds coherent with real short selling. Since they stay, a
   long position in one is bearish exposure the short-side ceiling cannot
   currently see. That exposure now counts against the same ceiling, and the
   Portfolio Manager knows these are bearish instruments. Correction 2026-08-30:
   a second commit in the same PR fixed a sign error: shorting an inverse ETF is
   bullish (betting the underlying index rises), not bearish, and must not consume
   the bearish budget. The setting was renamed from `risk.max_short_gross_pct` to
   `risk.max_gross_bearish_pct` to reflect the widened scope.
2. **DONE (PR #157)** — Widen the free news sources further. Per-company
   coverage now exists but is scoped to the names the desk holds or is watching
   that day instead of universally, capped so it does not explode to ~100 requests.
   Yahoo per-symbol only; Seeking Alpha was verified working and deliberately not
   enabled due to cost constraints.
3. **DONE (PR #160, merged during audit)** — The unbuilt half of the research-desk work: seats formally arguing out a
   disagreement, and a name more independent seats agree on earning a larger
   share of the risk budget. A target carrying an unadjudicated conflict is now dropped
   before grounding (punishment fits offence — single-target drop, not session-wide).
   Sizing by agreement is now in the deterministic risk code (not a model instruction):
   risk_allocation_pct is ceilinged by how many independent seats are directionally aligned,
   indexed by agreement count. Default schedule is [3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0]%, keeping
   1-source trades at 60% of the 5% envelope, 2-source at 80%, 3+ at full 100%.
4. **DONE (PR #159)** — Log every trade's allocated risk against how it actually turned out, so
   conviction can be judged from data. Each trade now carries its allocated risk
   percentage, stated conviction, and deciding model pinned at entry. Exit rows
   label whether they link to an originating decision or have none. The grouping
   of outcome-by-conviction exists but is gated: below 20 per bucket it reaches
   the human operator only and is kept out of every agent prompt.
5. **DONE (PR #156, with one gap since closed)** — The intra-session scan result that never
   reaches the session report. The rehearsal harness can now read the intraday
   scan's nested outcome from its own report instead of only the top-level status.
   At the time, two limitations were recorded and not fixed by design: the path is
   unit-tested but no current production replay actually contains an intraday_scan
   key (still true — none exist in live history), and a crashed scan produced no
   marker — the session read healthy and the operator could not see the crash.
   **Correction 2026-08-30 (PR #163): the crash gap is now closed** — a crashed
   scan attaches its own status and the session reports it as a failure.

**Next, in order**

1. **Phase 9 — the research desk deliberates.** Every seat may nominate a
   candidate; Technical becomes a responder rather than the gatekeeper on
   candidacy; material disagreements must be adjudicated, not just logged;
   conviction follows multi-source agreement. Full design in
   `docs/QAMC_REMEDIATION_SPEC.md` Phase 9. Depended on Phase 2b — now
   committed (`75c0233`, `feat/pm-flex-routing`) — because "agreement earns
   size" is meaningless until size is expressed as risk.

3. **Earnings filing extraction fix — PR #115 (`009ab78`, branch
   `feat/shorts-visible`, misnamed — it carries the earnings fix, not
   shorting), merged into `main`.** Deploy status is not tracked here — check
   `sudo -n -u qamc git -C /home/qamc/quant-agent log --oneline -1` against
   `git log origin/main` to see whether it has shipped yet. Corrects the diagnosis
   previously recorded here, which was wrong: the class is
   `EarningsDataProvider` (`src/data/earnings.py`), not `EarningsProvider`,
   and it was never doing a naive first-30,000-characters slice — structured
   section extraction and a density-seeking fallback both already existed.
   The real defect: `_extract_key_sections` matches the phrase "financial
   statements", which also appears verbatim inside the auditor's opinion
   letter ("...the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial
   statements)"). The acceptance test measured only LENGTH (≥3,000 chars), so
   that prose comfortably cleared the bar and suppressed the density-seeking
   fallback that would have found the real tables. Measured over the 68
   filings cached on the production box: 17 reached the earnings analyst
   starved (<40 financial figures), 12 of those with ZERO — MSFT, AAPL,
   GOOGL, BAC, CVX, NFLX among them. Fix: require ≥40 financial figures
   (dollar amounts, comma-grouped thousands, parenthesized negatives — the
   same pattern `_find_financial_dense_region` already scored by, now a
   shared module constant) in addition to length; failing the content check
   falls through to the fallback instead of returning. Re-measured across all
   68: 17 improved, 51 unchanged, 0 regressed, 0 starved.

4. **Insider routine/opportunistic filter — PR #133 opened against `main`, not yet
   merged/deployed.** See the "Landed" entry above (`feat/insider-signal-filter`)
   for what it does and the measured routine split with its caveat.

6. **Phase 4.2 — repair the data feeds.** News-feed half **DONE** (branch
   `fix/news-feeds-and-coverage`, 2026-08-28): Reuters/AP investigated live —
   neither is fixable for free (Reuters retired public RSS in 2020; AP's own
   feed requires a paid OAuth2 API, and the free third-party proxy is
   Cloudflare-walled) — both removed from `RSS_FEEDS`, Yahoo Finance News
   added as a partial free substitute, and `NewsCoverage` (`src/data/news.py`)
   now makes a dead feed impossible to miss: it's in the analyst's own prompt
   and in `data_status["news"]` (`ok`/`partial`/`failed`), which is what
   `trader_feed.py`/`notifier.py` already render as the operator-facing
   `⚠️ Data degraded` banner. **FRED half also DONE (2026-08-30, PR #162)** —
   see the "Landed (2026-08-30, later)" entry above; this line was left
   "still open" for two days after that stopped being true.
   (4.1, un-blindfolding the intraday buy path, is done — `fb88e08`,
   `feat/pm-flex-routing`, see the landed section above.)

7. **Phase 5 — short selling, now a three-stage plan.** The prior estimate
   recorded here — "bounded and additive, roughly a day, NOT a rewrite" — was
   **wrong**. A survey for Stage 1 found roughly 50 long-only assumptions
   across the money path, several failing silently: the constructor would
   re-open a held short every session (a short's weight was absent from
   `_current_weights`, so `.get(sym, 0.0)` read an already-held short as
   unheld); short orders bypass the risk engine entirely via an early
   `return []` on SELL; and shorts counted as zero portfolio risk in
   `portfolio_heat` (`qty <= 0` was excluded). Discovery still ALREADY WORKS —
   `TechAnalysisResult.rating` emits `sell` / `strong_sell` today. **Inverse
   ETFs are explicitly NOT the answer** — the owner rejected that workaround;
   he wants real short selling. Split into:

   1. **Make shorts countable — PR #116 (`feat/shorts-countable`, two commits
      `71325b1` + `a81bfde`), merged into `main`.** Deploy status is not
      tracked here — check `sudo -n -u qamc git -C /home/qamc/quant-agent log
      --oneline -1` against `git log origin/main`. Signed weights
      in `_current_weights`, side-aware `r_multiple`/`position_risk`/
      `portfolio_heat` in `src/risk/metrics.py`, and `qty != 0` (not `qty >
      0`) in every reporting filter (`src/storage/db.py`,
      `src/notifier.py`, `src/trader_feed.py`, `src/pipeline.py`). No order
      path is touched — the constructor emits nothing for a held short
      (`current_pct < 0`) rather than routing a cover or an add-to-short
      through paths that don't yet handle direction. 40 tests added
      (`tests/test_shorts_countable.py`), 21 of which failed pre-merge on
      `main` without this fix; the rest are a no-op wall proving long
      arithmetic is unperturbed.

   2. **Make shorts safe — landed 2026-08-28 (commit `10e0f10`, "Stage 2 of
      short selling: make shorts safe"; `tests/test_shorts_safe.py`, 28
      tests), merged to `main`.** Correction 2026-08-29: this line
      previously read "(not yet started)" — that was wrong as of today's
      check against origin/main; stage 2 is done, stage 3 below is what
      remains. Risk-engine routing so a SELL on an unheld symbol doesn't
      skip the deterministic gate via the early `return []`; stop direction
      (above entry) and trailing direction inverted for shorts; unbounded-loss
      margin accounting.

   3. **Turn it on (not yet started).** Order placement in the broker layer,
      then retire the inverse ETFs (`SH`, `SDS`, `PSQ`, `SQQQ`) as the
      bearish-expression mechanism. **Correction 2026-08-29: the first half
      is done — stage 3 (PR #150) landed and is merged and deployed, so
      shorts can be opened and covered.** The inverse-ETF retirement is
      still outstanding: `SH`/`SDS`/`PSQ`/`SQQQ` remain in the trading
      universe, now redundant rather than necessary.
   Alpaca is ready: `shorting_enabled: true`, `no_shorting: false`,
   `max_margin_multiplier: 4`, assets `shortable` with `borrow_status:
   easy_to_borrow`. The Alpaca paper account was verified on 2026-08-28 as
   already margin-enabled (`shorting_enabled: True`, `multiplier: 4`, equity
   $9,871.87) — no owner action is outstanding. (`docs/QAMC_REMEDIATION_SPEC.md`
   Phase 5 previously recorded an owner action to switch the account to
   margin; that is stale and has been corrected there.)

   **Known residual, needs a schema migration.** `pending_protection_restores`
   WAL rows predate shorts and carry no side column, so a row for a short's
   cancelled BUY stops looks byte-identical to one for a long's cancelled
   SELL stops. `_derive_close_side_for_drain` (`src/pipeline.py`) reads the
   broker's live signed position to tell them apart, but when that read
   itself fails, `_drain_pending_protection_restores` deliberately degrades
   to the pre-existing `sell` default rather than stalling the row —
   verified in the code and comments as of 2026-08-29. Unreachable today
   because shorts cannot yet be opened; becomes reachable, and wrong, the
   day they can. Close it as part of stage 3, not after. Current behaviour
   is pinned by `tests/test_shorts_emergency_close.py`'s crash-recovery
   drain-path coverage (added `e9851ea`, flagged by PR #135's own coverage
   audit as the one corner with zero tests) — read it before changing it.
   **Correction 2026-08-29: closed as part of stage 3, as planned.**
   `pending_protection_restores` now persists a `side` column, written at
   row-creation time by whoever is closing the position; the drain path
   prefers that persisted value and only falls back to the live-broker
   derivation (never a blind `sell` default) for a legacy row written before
   the migration. See `tests/test_wal_protection_side.py`.

8. **Phase 6 — cost circuit and transparency.** Dollar-based cap with an
   afternoon reserve; `position_id` linking a buy to the sell that closed it;
   surface the reasoning already stored but never displayed. **Correction
   2026-08-29: done** — see "Landed (2026-08-29)" at the top of this backlog.

#### THE REHEARSAL HARNESS — built, acceptance test PASSING (corrected 2026-08-29)
Merged to `main` as PR #122 (`feat/session-rehearsal`). Runs a full session offline against a snapshot of production, replaying recorded model responses. Free, deterministic, about 50 seconds. Blocks outbound network at the process level and proves the production database is byte-identical afterwards. Operator alerts are suppressed via `QAMC_REHEARSAL=1`.

**This section previously said the acceptance test did not pass. That was stale by the time it was read on 2026-08-29** — the fix landed the same day it was written, inside the same PR (`ee6f671`, "un-merge chunked agent rows so replay stops running dry"), and nothing after that commit ever came back to correct this text. Verified again on 2026-08-29 by re-running both acceptance tests from a fresh worktree against the live production snapshot: `pytest tests/test_rehearsal_replay.py tests/test_rehearsal_reproduces_cost_ceiling.py` — **11 passed**.

What was wrong and the fix: `tech_analyst.analyze_batch` auto-chunks a large symbol batch into several real provider calls (3 chunks + 1 missing-symbol recovery for the 2026-08-28 incident run, `agent_logs.provider_requests = 4`), then merges them into ONE `agent_logs` row before logging. Replay patches the provider transport, invoked once per real call, so it needed 4 recorded answers for that row and found 1 — the first chunk consumed it, every later chunk raised `MissingRecordedResponse`, and the resulting failure cascade masked the actual incident behind an unrelated `failed_call_unknown_cost` trip on `tech_analyst`. Fix (`ops/rehearsal/replay.py::_unmerge_chunked_call`): `analyze_batch` already joins each real call's text behind `"--- chunk i/N ---"` / `"--- missing-symbol recovery ---"` markers, in call order, in both `input_message` and `full_response` — a complete ordered record of the real calls a merged row represents. Replay now splits one row back into one `RecordedCall` per real call before matching, prorating merged-only token/cost figures by each part's share of the row text (last part takes the remainder, so parts always sum to exactly the recorded total).

With the chunk defect fixed, the harness reproduces the 2026-08-28 incident timeline exactly (`llm_circuit_events` on the live box: 09:32 defect 1 — projected session cost, `portfolio_manager`, session $0.0461 / day $0.0476; 11:15 operator reset; 11:30 defect 4 — paid-session count cap, `tech_analyst`, day $0.1765). `test_the_pre_fix_estimator_still_reproduces_the_2026_08_28_block` forces the old byte-as-a-token estimator back on through config (demanding more measured history than the ledger holds) and confirms the reserved-exposure ceiling still blocks the Portfolio Manager exactly as it did that morning, zero trades proposed or executed. `test_rehearsal_reproduces_2026_08_28_pm_cost_ceiling_failure` runs the same incident under the four cost-circuit fixes (PR #126, merged same day) and confirms the ceiling no longer fires and the Portfolio Manager is reached — the correct post-fix outcome. Both tests require `sudo -n -u qamc` read access to the production database and skip cleanly where that access is unavailable.

**Two more rig-only defects found 2026-08-29 by actually running the harness (not just its acceptance test) across `morning`/`midday`/`close`/`evening`/`intra_check` against the live snapshot, both fixed in the same pass:**

1. **`ResponseLibrary.match()` could crash on an ordinary, unpinned rehearsal.** Reproduced live: a plain `morning` rehearsal (no incident pinning, matching against full history) hit `TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'RecordedCall' and 'RecordedCall'` inside `scored.sort(reverse=True)`. Cause: `_unmerge_chunked_call` gives every part of one merged `agent_logs` row the same `row_id`, so two un-merged parts of one chunked row tie exactly on `(score, -row_id)` whenever they also tie on Jaccard score (trivially true when neither shares a word with the live prompt), forcing Python to compare the un-orderable `RecordedCall` objects to break the tie. In production this cascaded: tech_analyst's retry logic caught it as a call failure, exhausted retries, failed over to a second provider, hit the identical crash on the identical tied candidates, burned through the cost circuit's `provider_attempt_limit`, and suspended paid analysis for the rest of the session — a rig-only bug that looked exactly like a production incident. Fixed in `ops/rehearsal/replay.py` by ranking candidates by index instead of by object; `tests/test_rehearsal_replay.py::test_match_does_not_crash_when_two_unmerged_parts_of_one_row_tie` pins it.
2. **The verdict didn't know its own pipeline's status vocabulary.** `midday`, `close` and `intra_check` rehearsals that ran perfectly normally — no crash, no missing recording, no blocked agent — all came back `VERDICT: FAIL`, because `_verdict`'s healthy-status set only recognized `executed`/`no_orders`/`no_trades`/`market_holiday`. `run_position_review` (shared by midday/close) returns `"reviewed"` on a normal completion, `run_intra_check` returns `"ok"` when there is no loss violation (the common case on a 30-minute cadence), and `run_evening` returns `"analyzed"`. Production's own `src/trader_feed.py` and `src/notifier.py` already group these with the statuses the rig did recognize as healthy — the rig disagreeing with production about what counts as "this worked" is exactly the dishonest-output failure mode this harness exists to catch in the trading system, reproduced in the harness itself. Fixed in `ops/rehearsal/report.py`; `tests/test_rehearsal_report_verdict.py` pins it (new file, 6 tests).

Full suite: 2892 tests passed before this pass; +7 net new (1 in `test_rehearsal_replay.py`, 6 in new `tests/test_rehearsal_report_verdict.py`). Now lives at `ops/rehearsal/` on `origin/main`, not on a standalone branch/worktree; see "Session start" above for the owner's 2026-08-29 instruction to run it routinely.

**Hardening pass 2026-08-29 (second): verified the five just-added healthy statuses against `src/pipeline.py` directly rather than trusting the comments above, and audited every `run_*` session function for other gaps.** Found and fixed three more:

1. Three genuine *failure* statuses — `position_review_parse_error` (`run_position_review`/midday+close), `evening_analysis_error` and `evening_parse_error` (`run_evening`) — were already asserted as FAIL by this pass's own tests but had no `STATUS_PLAIN` entry at all, so each would have printed the generic "ended with status 'X'" fallback instead of a real explanation. Added.
2. `early_close` (`run_position_review`/midday+close, `src/pipeline.py:7806`) — a deliberate skip on half-day-holiday sessions, the same shape as `market_holiday` — was missing from both `STATUS_PLAIN` and the healthy set. Added to both.
3. `run_morning`'s PM-failure family — `pm_parse_error`, `pm_schema_error`, `pm_grounding_error`, `pm_repair_changed_decision` (`src/agents/portfolio_manager.py`, surfaced via `ctx.analysis_failure_status`) — were real, reachable statuses with no `STATUS_PLAIN` entry. Production's own `src/notifier.py`/`src/trader_feed.py` already match on `status.startswith("pm_")` as a PM-decision failure; the rig's vocabulary had not caught up. Added as failures (not healthy).

Also added `run_earnings_preprocess`'s statuses (`fetch_error`, `nothing_new`, `analysis_error`, `preprocessed`) pre-emptively — that session is real and scheduled but the rig still cannot invoke it (unchanged, separate gap, see below) — so the vocabulary is already correct on the day that gap closes.

One nuance worth recording: `intraday_no_trades`/`intraday_executed` (from the first hardening pass above) are correct in meaning but were found to be currently **unreachable** as `report.status` — they only ever appear nested at `result["intraday_scan"]["status"]` (`src/pipeline.py:8497-8498`), which `ops/rehearsal/report.py`'s `collect()` never reads; production's own `src/trader_feed.py` reads that nesting explicitly (`nested = result.get("intraday_scan")`, line 54) rather than trusting `result["status"]` for intra_check. Left in `STATUS_PLAIN`/the healthy set (harmless, correct-if-ever-reached) but the rig having no visibility into the intraday scan's own outcome is a real, separate gap — reported, not fixed here.

New guard test `tests/test_rehearsal_report_verdict.py::test_every_known_pipeline_terminal_status_is_classified` pins the full status vocabulary against a hardcoded, file:line-cited list (dynamic AST discovery was tried and rejected — the PM-failure family lives on `AgentResult.semantic_status`, set in a different file, not a string literal at the `"status"` key's return site, so a literal-string walk would silently miss exactly the drift this test exists to catch) — a future undocumented pipeline status now fails CI instead of printing raw.

Full suite: 2900 passed (2899 after the first hardening pass + this test).

#### BRANCHES READY, NO PR YET

- `feat/insider-signal-filter` — merged as PR #133, no longer pending
- `fix/news-feeds-and-coverage` — merged as PR #132

- `fix/dollar-based-session-cap` — its first commit, `766a35d`, added
  `afternoon_reserve_pct` (40) and `afternoon_reserve_release_et_hour` (12)
  plus a `_morning_spend_ceiling()` helper that was defined and never
  called. **Correction, 2026-08-29: superseded, not still open.**
  `_morning_spend_ceiling()` is called from `begin_call` in current `main`
  (`src/cost_circuit.py`), with dedicated passing tests
  (`tests/test_cost_circuit.py::test_morning_spend_ceiling_pure_computation`,
  `test_afternoon_reserve_blocks_morning_spend_above_the_ceiling`,
  `test_afternoon_reserve_recovers_the_same_day_without_a_rollover`) —
  landed via PR #126 (`fix/cost-circuit-four`) and PR #131
  (`fix/pricing-staleness`), both already merged. See "STILL OPEN —
  2026-08-29" item 5 below.

- `feat/bounded-repeg` — PR #144 opened 2026-08-29. Agent decision: merge it
  rather than leave it to rot, shipping the re-peg disabled by default. Check
  `gh pr list` for current status before treating this as landed.

- `MarketDataProvider.get_next_earnings_date()` is implemented but **unwired**;
  the Tech Analyst accepts a `days_to_earnings` kwarg that nothing supplies.
  **Correction: no longer true.** A real caller now exists
  (`src/data/event_calendar.py`, submitted through a bounded
  `ThreadPoolExecutor`), landed as part of closing defect (c) in
  `docs/phases.yaml`'s `open_defects` entry.

- Nothing tells the Portfolio Manager that `SH`, `SDS`, `PSQ` and `SQQQ` are
  bearish instruments, so even the sanctioned bearish expression is unwired.
  **Correction: no longer true.** `config/prompts/portfolio_manager.md` now
  carries a dedicated "Inverse ETFs are bearish, not a hedge-flavoured long"
  section (PR #158; also confirmed in `config/prompts/risk_manager.md`'s
  "Short discipline" section).

- 26 unmerged branches await triage, including two abandoned VPS security
  branches (`claude/vps-security-hardening-t8m3qz`,
  `claude/vps-deployment-hardening-q3f7k2`) worth rescuing before deletion.

## Moved out of docs/WORK.md, 2026-09-02 — finished 2026-09-01/2026-08-27 records

WORK.md is capped at 100,000 bytes and had grown past it. These sections describe work that shipped, merged or deployed and were already superseded by the state block at the top of WORK.md. They are moved here verbatim, not trimmed, because this log is append-only.

### The 2026-09-01 handoff — branches, Phase 11 merge record, telegram deep link

**START HERE — 2026-09-01 handoff. Everything below is a POINTER; the detail
lives in the files named and is not repeated.**

**Read first, in this order:**
1. `docs/QAMC_REMEDIATION_SPEC.md` **Phase 12** — four decisions Rex ratified
   2026-09-01. Nothing is implemented. This is the work.
2. Then **Phase 10** (per-trade risk verdict, macro sizes rather than selects,
   concentration scales, target from levels) and **Phase 11** (fractional
   sizing, 2.0x margin).
3. `docs/OUTCOME.md` — "This is a trading desk, not a retirement portfolio".
   Read before touching any risk rule; it decides which rules are legitimate.
4. `docs/INCIDENT_HISTORY.md` — what already broke and was fixed. Append-only.

**Why it matters:** on 2026-09-01 the desk reviewed 38 qualified signals and
placed zero trades. Root cause is Phase 12.1. It is still unfixed.

**Owner instruction: ship everything in ONE pass, tonight.** Deliberate
acceptance of change risk (Phase 12.4) — the desk cannot trade at all, so a
partial fix leaves it that way. **The rehearsal rig is the mitigation and must
run against the merged result before deploy.**

**Six branches, all pushed, none merged, none deployed:**

| branch | spec | tests |
|---|---|---|
| `fix/risk-verdict-per-trade` | 10.1 | 3853 pass |
| `fix/concentration-scales-size` | 10.3 | 3848 pass |
| `fix/target-from-structure` | 10.4 | 3850 pass |
| `feat/golden-pm-prompt` | PM prompt rewrite + Phases 10/11/12 in the spec | 3848 pass, 1 unrelated |
| `feat/telegram-run-deeplink` | symbol links + company names in alerts | full suite green |
| `rescue/price-provenance` | rescued 11-day-old work — **parked, NOT mergeable**, reference only |

**Merge hazard, read before merging anything:** spec Phases 10/11/12 exist ONLY
on `feat/golden-pm-prompt`. The three fix agents could not see them and each
wrote its own reconstructed Phase 10 into the spec. **Merge
`feat/golden-pm-prompt` FIRST, then reconcile the others' spec sections against
it — the owner-ratified text is the one on that branch, not the
reconstructions.**

**The model-benchmark results are STALE — do not choose a PM model from them.**
Every score in `ops/model_policy/results/*2026-09-01*.json` was measured against
the OLD prompt, which is what produced the restrictive behaviour, so the scores
are entangled with it. **The rig does not need rewriting, only re-running** —
`benchmark_models.py` drives the real agent class, which reads
`config/prompts/portfolio_manager.md` from disk, so re-running after the
rewritten prompt lands tests the new prompt automatically. Keep the DIAGNOSIS
(gpt-5.5 picked SPY in 5 of 5 runs and never proposed more than 2 positions —
the most literal rule-follower, hence the most timid under a prompt full of
"never"); discard the RANKING. Expect absolute scores to rise across the board
if the rewrite works, so compare rankings, not numbers. **Also re-examine the
`actionable_book` check itself** — if the new prompt legitimately produces more
targets, that check may now be too easy to pass and stop discriminating.

**Universe expansion and pruning — DESIGN AGREED WITH THE OWNER 2026-09-01,
never written down until now. Not built. Do not redesign it; implement this.**

Today the 101-symbol universe is a hand-written list. Symbols CAN be added
dynamically but only narrowly: up to 3/run via SEC Form 4 smart-money
admission, and up to 3 per seat / 6 total per run via Phase 9 nominations.
**Nothing ever removes a symbol.**

*Admission screen.* The criteria already exist under `smart_money:` but are
used only to admit outsiders, never to BUILD the list. Reuse them, with these
corrections:
- **A year of price history minimum.** `min_external_history_days: 20` is
  badly wrong — the analysis computes a 200-day moving average and its slope,
  so a symbol admitted at 20 days produces blanks in the fields the analyst
  leans on hardest.
- **Screen on bid-ask spread, not the $10m dollar-volume floor.** $10m/day is
  far stricter than a ~$10k account needs, and it screens the wrong thing:
  what costs money is the spread.
- **Require shortable / easy-to-borrow.** Half the point is bearish trades.
- **Exclude warrants, units and rights.** Delisted warrants already reached
  the data layer once and caused a recursion fault.
- **Exclude names under a pending takeover** — an acquisition target trades
  flat at the deal price, so every technical signal becomes noise while
  looking like a calm uptrend.
- **Volatility ceiling.** A name so wild that its structural stop is enormous
  fails reward:risk by construction — screen it at the door rather than
  rejecting it daily.
- **Minimum company size**, so a micro-cap cannot qualify on one freak volume
  day.
- **NO earnings-date requirement.** Considered and REJECTED by the owner: ETFs
  have no earnings and ~20 of the universe are ETFs. Reducing their size for a
  missing date is equally wrong. Dropped entirely.
- **No maximum price** — Phase 11.1 turned fractional sizing on (built
  2026-09-01), so a $500 share is no longer unsizeable.

*Pruning.* Nothing does this today.
- **Re-screen weekly.** Fail once -> flagged. Fail twice consecutively ->
  removed. One bad week must not evict a good name.
- **NEVER remove a symbol currently held.** That cuts a live position off from
  analysis while its stop still sits at the broker — unwatched but real.
- **Immediate removal, no second chance,** when the broker reports the asset
  does not exist, or it is delisted or permanently halted.
- **Log every addition and removal with its reason, and summarise them in the
  morning alert.** The owner must never discover the universe changed by
  accident.

*Cost.* Scanning is free — the specialist seats run on the free Gemini tier
(measured 2026-09-01: `tech_analyst` processed 307,754 input tokens at $0.00).
The cost is the PM reading a longer candidate list. **Cap how many screened
candidates reach the PM**, the same way `NominationConfig` already caps
nominations, so the bill is a number that is set rather than one that emerges.
Untested risk: the free tier is rate-limited and a much wider scan may hit it.

**Phase 11 status, 2026-09-01, after verification and merge — this replaces
both earlier claims, which had each gone stale in a different direction.**

**MERGED and verified on `integration/ship-2026-09-01`:**
- **Margin interest tracker.** Measures only, never gates. Review found and
  fixed a real defect: it fast-exited whenever `allow_margin` was false and so
  never read cash at all — unsafe, because covering a losing short is exempt
  from the cash-only block and can carry a genuine debit balance.
- **The sector cap no longer switches itself off.** Pre-existing rot,
  reproduced against pristine `af266de`: a holding at 85% of equity plus a 10%
  order, both in an unresolved sector, produced ZERO violations — 95% pooled
  straight past the 90% ceiling. 80 of 101 universe symbols depend on a live
  network lookup with no offline fallback, so the cap was inert for most of
  what the desk trades. Verified NOT over-broad: cash-park never reaches the
  code, index and sector ETFs resolve from static tables offline.
- **Phase 11.2's ceiling and ladder.** 2.0x gross cap at the sizing and
  execution gates; the ladder stepping 2.0/1.5/1.0/0.5 on peak-to-trough
  drawdown. Both owner gates verified BY MUTATION, not by reading the tests:
  breaking the ladder so it never steps fails 24 of 55 tests, making it trim
  to make room fails 6, making the rung compound fails 2. The ladder runs in
  the session preamble BEFORE any agent, from account state alone, so a blank
  PM response cannot skip it — which is not hypothetical, a benchmark run that
  night had one candidate model return an empty book on 1 run in 5.

- **Phase 11.1, fractional sizing and its three stop guards — MERGED.** — fractional
sizing and its three stop guards. No path leaves a fractional position
silently unprotected; the owner alert fires unconditionally after every
protection attempt. Review found and fixed a real gap: the 30-minute sweep's
repair belt used a bare single-shot stop submit with no retry and no
whole-share fallback — the same weakness the entry guard exists to close.

**`allow_margin` REMAINS `false`.** The ceiling was built before borrowing is
enabled; that was the sequencing requirement and it held. The flag and the PM
prompt's exposure table move together, later, after the rehearsal rig has run
against the merged result.

**Still to build:** the wider universe with pruning (design recorded below, no
code), and Phase 10.2 deterministic analyst weighting.

**Open, documented, not blocking:** the live rung is not on Mission Control.
`src/api/` may never import `src.risk` (ratified guardrail,
`tests/test_api_safety.py`), so the dashboard shows the standing cap only; the
session alert is the sole operator surface until the measurement functions
move out of the risk package. Also worth the owner's eye: the ladder
introduces a SECOND drawdown measure (peak-to-trough against a 252-day
high-water mark) alongside the existing rolling-window one. One table, one
resolver, so the mechanism is not duplicated — but it adds a measure rather
than reusing the existing one.

**Phase 11 was MISSING from this line until 2026-09-01 and that caused a real
scope error.** A session read this list, built Phase 12 and the branch merges,
and correctly believed Phase 11 was out of scope. Verified by search across
every branch: no fractional sizing anywhere, and **no gross-exposure cap of any
kind exists** — `max_portfolio_risk_pct` bounds AT-RISK capital, not gross. So
11.2 ADDS a ceiling where none exists; it is a tightening, not a loosening, and
it must land before `allow_margin` is turned on.

**Phase 12.1/12.2/12.3 are now IMPLEMENTED** (2026-09-01) along with the five
open branches. Phase 10.2 — computing analyst weighting in Python so no seat
dominates by prompt position — is also still unbuilt.

**Baseline:** `pytest tests/ -q` gives 2 pre-existing failures in
`tests/test_rehearsal_reproduces_cost_ceiling.py` — they read live production
state and pass in CI. Anything else failing is yours.


**READY TO DEPLOY, WAITING ONLY ON THE MARKET CLOSING — do this first.**
**MERGED 2026-09-01 into `integration/ship-2026-09-01`** — verified with
`git merge-base --is-ancestor`. This entry previously said "not merged",
which was wrong and was repeated onward before being checked. **What is
still owed is the DEPLOY, not the merge.**

Branch `feat/telegram-run-deeplink`. Makes
every ticker in a Telegram alert tappable through to that company's quote
page. Full suite green: 3837 passed, 1 skipped, and only the two known
`test_rehearsal_reproduces_cost_ceiling.py` failures that read live
production state.

It was NOT deployed on 2026-09-01 for two specific reasons, neither of
which is "later, vaguely":
1. The market was open (12:44 ET) with the midday session 16 minutes out.
   Deploying restarts the trading service; mid-session is the wrong moment.
2. It touches `main.py` and `src/scheduler.py`, not only message text — so
   the rehearsal-rig rule above applies and the rig has not been run
   against it yet.

**Superseded 2026-09-01 22:00 UTC:** the merge is done, so the remaining
order is: run the rehearsal rig against the merged integration branch, wait
for CI, deploy, restart, confirm the served bundle matches disk.

**Timing constraint, measured from the live timers rather than assumed:** the
production evening session fires at 23:30 UTC and several timers fire with
it; the morning run is 13:00 UTC, half an hour before the open. Deploying
restarts the service, so the window is AFTER the evening session completes
and BEFORE 13:00 UTC.

Rex asked directly: "who's gonna remember to deploy it? I'm not gonna
remember." This entry is the answer. It stays here until it is deployed,
and whoever picks this file up next is the one who owes him the deploy.

**Known and deliberately NOT fixed on that branch** (do not let it block
the merge): the alerts still link to the Mission Control home page rather
than to the specific run. The cockpit has no URL routing whatsoever — no
router package, no query or hash parsing anywhere in `frontend/src`, and
`selectedRunId` is in-memory `useState` only. Deep-linking needs ~15 lines
in `App.tsx` to read `?run=<id>` on mount for same-day runs, and more than
that for older ones, because there is no UI to view a non-current run at
all. Separately: `_append_company_identities` in `src/notifier.py` is dead
code for real trading alerts — `src/pipeline.py` emits `executed`/
`no_trades`, which route to `trader_feed.py`'s own formatters, and those
never call `CompanyProfileStore`. That is why company names have never
appeared in an alert.

### The 2026-08-27 evening deploy

**Historical — the 2026-08-27 evening deploy.** As of that evening,
production was deployed at `46b2029` (merge of PR #113,
`feat/pm-flex-routing`), superseding `32c174b` (PR #114, the deploy-drift
alarm, merged on top of `e6ada88` — PR #113 carries `32c174b` in its own
merge history). Phase 3 (exit rework), the execution limit fix, the
deploy-drift alarm, Phase 2b risk-based sizing, the stop-width fix, the
OpenRouter flex-routing change and the intraday un-blindfolding were all live
as of that deploy: seven positions open, all with broker-resident stops,
`paper: true`, daily LLM budget raised to $2.75. (Earlier same-day notes had
claimed `18dd4bc`, then `e6ada88`, as the deploy SHA; `18dd4bc` was never
actually on the box, and `e6ada88` was superseded within the same session —
recorded here only for the forensic trail, not because it matters now.)
**None of this paragraph describes current state** — use the command above.

**Historical — 2026-08-27 night, nothing further deployed, deliberately.**
The sizing and stop-width change (`3dff940`, part of the deploy above) had
its first live session 2026-08-28 09:30 ET, and the operator chose not to
confound that read with another deploy that night. PR #115 (earnings fix)
and PR #116 (shorts Stage 1) were both open, reviewed, and intentionally left
undeployed that night. **Whether they are deployed now is a different
question — check reality, above, and see the ordered backlog below.**

**Historical — deploy-drift alarm (PR #114, `9eef617` + `38a985c`), landed in
the 2026-08-27 deploy.** `scripts/check_deploy_drift.py` plus
`quant-agent-drift-check.timer` (Mon-Fri 08:45 ET) alerts over Telegram when
the box's deployed HEAD falls behind `origin/main`. Built because PR #111 sat
merged-but-undeployed for eight hours with nothing catching it. Verified
firing.

**Historical — also in the 2026-08-27 deploy, PR #113 (`feat/pm-flex-routing`,
merged as `46b2029`):**

- `75c0233` Phase 2b risk-based sizing + the correlation-aware risk budget
  gate — **the highest-consequence change in this deploy.** It decides how
  much money each trade may lose. `b712f4c` and `3dff940` land on top of it,
  same branch: the constructor now clamps to the risk engine's 20%
  single-name ceiling instead of proposing orders it hard-blocks, and entry
  stops sitting inside ordinary volatility get pushed out to a
  regime-and-setup-scaled ATR floor (`risk.min_stop_atr_multiple`) — a
  widened stop that drops reward:risk below 1.5 rejects the trade outright.
  Measured against the real book: MSFT's stop went 2.4% → 7.0%, VLO 4.5% →
  9.2%, OKLO 7.7% → 24.7%, and 0.5/1.0/1.5% conviction now produces
  7.1/14.2/20.0% positions instead of clamping all three to 20%. First live
  session under this change is 2026-08-28 09:30 ET.
- `fb88e08` the intraday PM un-blindfolding.
- `16f6535` the PM's OpenRouter `openai/flex` endpoint routing.
- `6b7af86` the Mission Control `input_message` surface, `cdb387b` the
  sector-stance vocabulary + `TypeError` crash fix, `002095c` risk-sized
  targets reappearing in the cockpit funnel, `300ea14` + `6f897a1` + `55f0e05`
  the benchmark-harness repair and its guards, and the `docs:` commits.

### 2026-09-03 — a level needs 5 touches, not 2, before a tight stop trusts it

**In plain words:** Phase 12.1 lets the desk honour a stop however tight,
as long as it sits on a real price level the system computed from the
chart. That was safe only if "real level" meant something solid — but the
bar for a level to count at all was just 2 touches, ever, anywhere across
roughly three years of history. Two old, possibly coincidental turning
points could justify a razor-thin stop. This closes that gap: a level now
needs 5 touches before a stop resting on it earns the tight-stop exemption.
Below 5, the stop is widened to the ATR band instead, exactly as if nothing
computed backed it at all — the trade does not become untradeable, it just
loses the exemption.

**Why 5, not some other number:** derived from the measured table in
`docs/RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md` §7 (101 symbols, 5 years of daily bars, real
price series against a shuffled control that keeps the same volatility and
destroys only the ordering). Real-vs-shuffled bounce probability only
separates with non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals at 5+ touches — real
0.644 [0.590, 0.696] against shuffled 0.505 [0.470, 0.539], a full 0.05 gap
between the real floor and the shuffled ceiling. Every bucket below that
overlaps or nearly touches the shuffled range (2 touches: real floor 0.510
equals shuffled ceiling 0.510; 3 and 4 touches overlap outright), which
means the apparent edge at those touch counts could be noise rather than a
real effect. 5 is the first point in the table where the finding stops being
marginal. Recency was deliberately NOT added as a second requirement — the
same research found no age effect in the daily sample at all (likelihood
ratio 0.00), so a level defended three years ago predicts a bounce exactly
as well as one defended last week, in the data actually measured.

**What did NOT change:** `find_structural_levels`' own `MIN_TOUCHES = 2` in
`src/data/levels.py`, which decides whether a level exists at all (shown to
the analyst, eligible as a target). That bar was deliberately left alone —
§12.1's own text already treats "does a level exist" and "do we trust this
level enough to honour a razor-thin stop on it" as two different questions,
and only the second one is being answered here. The fallback when a level
misses the new bar is the pre-existing ATR-floor widening logic — unchanged,
just now reached from one more path.

**Where it's wired:** `TechAnalysisResult.computed_level_touches` (new
field, Python-set like `computed_levels`, never model-writable) carries each
level's touch count alongside its price. `PortfolioConstructor.
_level_backing_stop` now requires `risk.min_level_touches_for_stop_honor`
(shipped at 5) touches on the matched level before treating a stop as
verified; a level present but missing from the touches map fails closed
(treated as unverified), per Invariant 2. The backtest engine
(`src/backtest/engine.py`) computes and threads the same touch map so it
keeps exercising the same rule the live path runs.

**Owner's standing instruction, recorded so it isn't re-litigated:** "you
have my approval to just go with whatever the research says, we can always
make adjustments if that isn't working" — this is a research-derived
threshold, not an agent guess at a market-structure constant, and it is
revisable the same way every other placeholder threshold on this desk is.

### 2026-09-03 — the catalyst exception only checked that news existed, not whether it was good or bad news; now it checks both

**In plain words:** a below-floor trade can be let through if it points at a
specific, dated news event about that stock (the "sub-floor catalyst
exception," shipped 2026-09-02 — see §10.4a above). That check only
confirmed the cited news event was real and about the right stock. It never
asked whether the news was actually GOOD news for a BUY or BAD news for a
SHORT. A stock could be sinking on genuinely bad news and still walk through
the door meant for good news, because the door only checked "does this news
exist," not "does this news agree with the trade." Now it checks both: the
cited news must exist, name the stock, AND be recorded as supporting the
direction of the trade — good news for a long, bad news for a short.
Neutral news, or news with no recorded direction at all, no longer qualifies
either way.

**Why revise the rule instead of just deleting the exception.** Published
research on rule overrides in trading systems says an override of a
systematic rule only helps when it carries a real quality bar — a rule
override with no quality bar tends to hurt more than it helps, because it
lets exactly the weakest cases (the ones a systematic rule was designed to
block) sneak through on a technicality. The owner reviewed this before
authorizing the work. So the fix keeps the exception (it still lets a
capped, small position through when the news genuinely supports the trade)
and makes the bar it must clear a real one, rather than removing the escape
hatch entirely.

**Why this was buildable now, not before.** The news analyst was already
making a bullish/bearish/neutral call for individual stock news items
(`StockNewsItem.sentiment` in `src/models.py`) — it just never carried that
judgment onto the separate table the catalyst gate actually reads
(`StateChange`, which only had a free-text `market_impact` description, no
structured field). This fix adds a `symbol_direction` field to
`StateChange` — a dict from symbol to bullish/bearish/neutral, not a single
value for the whole row, because one state-change event routinely means
opposite things for different stocks (example already in the news analyst's
own prompt: a ceasefire and falling oil is bullish for consumer names and
bearish for energy names, in the same event). It is filled in by the exact
same news_analyst call that already produces `StockNewsItem.sentiment` — no
new LLM call, no new analyst seat, just a second structured field asked for
in the same response.

**Where it's wired.** `StateChange.symbol_direction` (`src/models.py`),
normalized the same way `conviction` already is (case-folded; an
unrecognized value is dropped for that symbol rather than crashing the
whole news report). `TradingPipeline._build_active_state_changes`
(`src/pipeline.py`) renders each symbol with its direction inline —
`SYMBOL(bullish)` / `SYMBOL(bearish)` / `SYMBOL(neutral)` / `SYMBOL(unknown)`
when no direction was recorded — into the same rendered block the PM has
always read state-changes from. `PortfolioManagerAgent.
_state_change_symbols_by_date` and `_catalyst_cites_state_change`
(`src/agents/portfolio_manager.py`) parse that back out and require the
cited row's direction for the target's own symbol to match what the trade
needs: bullish for a BUY, bearish for a SHORT. Fail-closed throughout, same
posture as the rest of this gate: a symbol with no recorded direction, or a
neutral one, does not qualify — it is never treated as "probably fine."
Config-prompt updated (`config/prompts/news_analyst.md`) so the news analyst
knows this field is read by code, not decorative.

**What did NOT change.** The existence-and-recency requirements from
§10.4a (a citation must resolve to a stored row, dated correctly, within the
14-day window, naming the symbol) are untouched — this adds a further
requirement on top, it does not loosen or replace them. The starter-size cap
on a qualifying sub-floor pick is unchanged. Exits and reductions remain
exempt from the whole gate, as before.

### 2026-08-28 — the new stop rule rejected four BUYs on its first day (RESOLVED)

**In plain words:** four candidates got refused the day the new reward:risk
floor shipped, which looked like the new rule was too strict. It wasn't —
the numbers it was checking were never real measurements to begin with.

CRM (0.39), ONDS (0.78), MP (0.80) and NVDA (1.30) were all rejected on
reward:risk, prompting the question of whether the profit targets were too
conservative or the stops too wide. Answered: neither. The targets being
compared against the stops were not measurements at all, so those ratios
never meant what they appeared to — do not cite them as evidence about
stop width. That day's zero trades had two independent causes, not one:
the cost circuit separately blocked the whole morning, and these four were
refused on payoff.

### 2026-09-02 — earnings data quality: broken section-matching, fixed with SEC's own numbers

**In plain words:** the earnings reader was truncating filings so badly
that a third of what it read back was worthless, and it also let a made-up
valuation number get stuck in the cache for days. Both fixed.

Text-regex heading match to find the right section of a 10-Q/10-K is
inherently unreliable across filers: ~20 of 67 filings recovered under
1,600 characters out of a 184k-character filing, and 12 — including
MSFT/AAPL/GOOGL/BAC/CVX/NFLX — extracted ZERO figures. Root cause was the
section-match approach itself, not sparse underlying data. Fixed by pulling
the numbers from SEC's structured XBRL API instead, independent of the
text matcher, and verified against live SEC data.

Separately, a fabricated valuation claim (P/E, market cap invented despite
no price data given to the model) was detected but never closed the loop —
the same bad number re-served from cache for days on KO and MTZ. Now
redacted at source, and the cache self-heals instead of re-serving a
flagged value. See PR merging `fix/earnings-data-quality`.

### 2026-09-02 — smart_money token ceiling was 13x too small, truncating real calls

**In plain words:** one research seat had a much smaller word limit than
every other seat, for no measured reason, and it was cutting off real
answers in production.

Token ceiling (1200) was 13x smaller than every other seat with no
measured justification; a real call truncated in production as a result.
Resized to 3000 from measured production usage, and truncation now gets
its own `data_status` value instead of hiding inside "empty" (which made
it indistinguishable from a seat that legitimately had nothing to say).
See PR merging `fix/smart-money-tokens`.

### 2026-09-03 — evening analyst audit: empty-string Literal fields slipped past the null guard

**In plain words:** the evening reviewer's "missed opportunity" notes were
getting silently dropped some nights — not because the model refused to
answer, but because when it left an optional field blank it sometimes
wrote an empty string instead of a proper "no answer" marker, and the
existing safety net only recognized the proper marker.

This seat was flagged by a peer session as having "17 validation
failures, NOT YET AUDITED" — that count was stale. The retained journal
(2026-08-14 through 2026-09-03) holds 61 per-entry drop warnings across
`missed_opportunities` and `buy_grades`/`sell_grades`, none of which ever
took down a whole evening report — the per-entry isolation added after the
2026-05-01 incident (see PR #73) was already doing its job.

Three genuinely different things were bundled under that one number:

1. **A real, still-open bug, now fixed.** `MissedOpportunity.theme_durability`
   is an optional Literal field defaulting to `"unknown"`. The 2026-09-02
   fix for "explicit null means absent" (`LLMOutputModel
   ._explicit_null_means_absent`) taught the schema to treat a JSON `null`
   on such a field as "field omitted, apply the default" — but the model
   doesn't only say `null` when it means "no answer"; on
   2026-09-03 it emitted `""` for BIAF and GPRO, which is the identical
   intent expressed differently. `""` is not `None`, so the guard's
   `is None` check missed it, the empty string then failed Literal
   validation, and the whole entry was dropped. Fixed by extending the
   guard to treat `""` the same as `null` for every field already covered
   by it — safe because those fields were chosen specifically for
   rejecting `None` while carrying their own default, so on a
   already-empty-by-default field (like `universe_addition_reason`) the
   change is a no-op, and on every other affected field (all in this
   codebase's LLM-output models) an empty string was never a meaningful,
   distinct value in the first place.
2. **An already-fixed regression, confirmed closed by the evidence.** A
   separate, disjoint set of `buy_grades` drops (RSG, ONDS, CCJ, DIS,
   CMCSA, MSFT, ABT, V, OKLO — 3 validation errors each) recurred on
   2026-08-29, 09-01 and 09-02: the model was confusing the "Recent BUY
   decisions to grade" list with the much larger "Thesis Health Review"
   section and emitting `BuyGrade`-shaped junk with `SellGrade` field
   names for symbols outside the actual grading candidate list. This
   pattern stopped appearing in the log the moment the earlier-tonight
   scope-guard fix (`fix/evening-buy-grades-scope`, PR #216, plus its own
   follow-up fix `db81e20` for the `allowed_symbols=None` vs `[]`
   distinction) landed — exact symbol list and error count match. Not
   re-fixed here; this entry exists to record that the "17 failures" claim
   was, in part, this already-closed issue.
3. **Working as designed, not a bug.** `MissedOpportunity._theme_required_
   for_real_misses` rejects a `value_entry_missed`/`trend_timing_miss`/etc.
   entry with an empty `theme_if_any` (e.g. AGX on 2026-09-03) — this is
   the deliberate quarterly-aggregation discipline documented at the
   validator's call site (2026-05-01 incident note), not a defect. Left
   alone.

### 2026-09-03 — a dead price feed and a genuinely quiet market used to look identical; now the desk can tell them apart

**In plain words:** every trade needs a real chart level to set a stop
against, so the code has always refused to trade a symbol when it can't
find one. That refusal is correct. The problem was that "no level because
the price feed died" and "no level because this stock's chart is genuinely
flat right now" produced the exact same blank result, and nothing counted
how often it happened across a run — so a morning where the data feed
silently went dark would have shown up in every log and report as an
ordinary quiet day. This closes that gap: the desk now counts, every run,
what share of symbols came back with no usable price history or no
structural level, and pages the owner directly — outside the routine
end-of-session summary — when that share is too high to be a coincidence.

This was built proactively, not in response to a live incident. It was
investigated after 2026-08-25's zero-trade day (item 11 in
`docs/WORK.md`) raised the question of whether a silent feed outage could
produce a day like that; it could not have been THAT day specifically
(`TechAnalysisResult.computed_levels`, the field this watchdog reads,
did not exist yet in the code that ran that morning — the real cause was
the unrelated R/R-geometry defect recorded elsewhere in this file), but
the fix that shipped that same night made `computed_levels` load-bearing
going forward, and this closes the resulting hole before it causes a
second, real incident.

**The mechanism.** `MorningResearchStage._run_tech` already fetches bars
for the whole tech universe before anything else happens; it now also
counts how many of those fetches came back empty (`ctx.tech_bars_coverage`
— universe size, bars fetched, bars missing, and which symbols). Once the
tech analyses for the run resolve, `_check_levels_coverage` computes a
second figure: what share of the RESOLVED analyses carry an empty
`computed_levels`. Both are persisted as one `levels_coverage`
`specialist_evidence` row every run, whether or not anything looks wrong —
observability here is not conditional on severity, because the one normal
day nobody re-checks is exactly the day a silent regression needs a
record.

Two thresholds, both module constants in `src/pipeline_stages.py`, gate
whether the owner is paged and require at least
`LEVELS_COVERAGE_MIN_SAMPLE` (10) resolved symbols or fetch attempts
before either can fire — a 1-in-3 empty result on a 3-symbol test run is
noise, not a signal, and 10 is well below the real universe's 100+ names:

- `LEVELS_BLIND_RUN_EMPTY_SHARE = 1.0` — every single symbol came back
  empty. A live feed does not put every unrelated chart in one batch into
  the identical null state at once; this can only be a property of the
  feed, not of the market. Alerts 🔴 TECH DATA BLIND SPOT.
- `LEVELS_DEGRADED_RUN_EMPTY_SHARE = 0.5` — a deliberately coarse line,
  not a fitted percentile: only one clean baseline run exists to derive it
  from (2026-09-02's morning run, 1 empty out of 64 resolved, 1.6%), and
  n=1 cannot support a statistically fit threshold. 50% sits roughly 30x
  that single observed baseline — far above anything an ordinary quiet
  name (a thin IPO, a rangebound stock) should produce across a whole run
  — while still catching a partial outage that the 1.0 rule alone would
  miss, such as a feed serving short or stale history to most but not
  literally all requests. Alerts 🟠 TECH DATA DEGRADED.

The alert reuses the desk's existing out-of-band channel
(`src/notifier.send_owner_alert`, the same path the "NO STOP AT ALL" /
"STOP PARTIALLY COVERS" protective-stop alerts use) rather than a new one,
and matches the standing alert-design rule from the 2026-09-02 data-quality
work: its own Telegram message, never bundled into the routine session
summary, severity carried in text rather than colour alone.

The check runs unconditionally after the tech stage's try/except, whether
tech resolved cleanly, partially, not at all, or crashed outright — a bars
outage severe enough to crash the whole batch is exactly the case this
exists to catch, not one to skip because the surrounding try/except already
handled the crash. Like `_persist_evidence`, it never raises: a bug in the
watchdog itself must never be able to stop a trading session.

### 2026-09-03 — RM modification symbol matching was case-sensitive — FIXED

**In plain words:** when the Risk Manager tightens an already-decided trade
(e.g. widens a stop), the code has to find which decision that change
belongs to by matching symbols. That match was case-sensitive. If the RM
ever emitted a symbol in a different case than the Portfolio Manager's
original decision (e.g. "aapl" vs "AAPL"), the match silently failed and
the trade shipped completely UNMODIFIED — the opposite of this codebase's
usual fail-closed posture for a mismatch like this. Never observed live;
found in the same 2026-09-03 read that produced item 27 in `docs/WORK.md`
(item 26 there).

**The mechanism, and why the fix moved after a first pass.** The first
pass fixed the obvious comparison — `TradingPipeline
._apply_risk_modifications` in `src/pipeline.py`, which compared
`decision.symbol` to `mod.symbol` directly — by normalizing both sides at
that one comparison site. Checking for other readers of `mod.symbol`
before calling this closed found a SECOND, independent case-sensitive
comparison in `src/pipeline_stages.py` (`decision.symbol in
modified_symbols`, which decides whether a symbol's funnel outcome reads
"modified" or "approved") that the first pass would have left equally
wrong. Rather than patch a second site (and risk a third going
unnoticed), the fix moved to the model boundary: `RiskModification` now
carries the same normalizing field validator `SymbolRejection` already
has (`src/models.py`, `_normalize_symbol`, `strip().upper()`) — every
current and future reader of `RiskModification.symbol` gets a normalized
value automatically, the same "one definition" discipline already applied
elsewhere in this codebase. Covered by
`tests/test_bugfixes.py::test_risk_mod_matches_decision_symbol_case_insensitively`
and `::test_risk_mod_symbol_normalized_at_the_model_boundary` (the second
comparison site, proven directly).

### 2026-09-03 — a held position's risk could vanish from the portfolio ceiling if only heat data failed

**In plain words:** two independent portfolio-level ceilings (25% of equity
at risk total, plus a per-theme cap) exist to stop the desk piling into
correlated bets. Both ceilings need to know what's ALREADY on the book, not
just what's being requested today. That "already on the book" number comes
from one data source (heat); the theme groupings come from a separate one
(correlation clusters). If heat failed to build but clusters still did, the
code ran the ceiling check anyway — treating the unmeasurable held book as
if it held zero risk. New trades could then be approved on top of a real,
already-at-risk book, right up to the full ceiling, with nothing in the
logs distinguishing this from a legitimately empty book. Item 27 in
`docs/WORK.md`.

**The mechanism.** `_book_risk_inputs` (`src/pipeline_stages.py`) builds
`existing` (per-symbol risk %, from `facts.heat`) and `clusters` (from
`facts.correlation_clusters`) independently, so a heat failure alone
returns `(None, clusters)` rather than `(None, None)`. The call site in
`PortfolioConstructor._plan_risk_targets` (`src/portfolio_constructor.py`)
gated `allocate_risk_budget(...)` on `existing_risk_pct is not None or
clusters is not None` — an OR, so `clusters` alone was enough to run the
allocator. Inside `allocate_risk_budget` (`src/risk/budget.py`), a `None`
`existing_pct` becomes `{}`, so `committed = sum(... for sym not in
by_symbol)` came out to 0 regardless of what the book actually carried.
This is the same failure direction the code already gets right when BOTH
inputs are missing (ceilings deliberately unenforced, since "enforcing a
number against a book you can't see" is worse than not enforcing it) — the
OR condition just meant that reasoning only applied to the total-failure
case, not the equally-blind partial one.

**The fix.** The gate now reads `existing_risk_pct is not None` only.
`clusters` remains an optional refinement once `existing_risk_pct` is
known — `allocate_risk_budget` already handles `clusters=None` by applying
just the total ceiling, which is an honest degraded mode. A heat failure
now degrades exactly like a total facts failure: ceilings unenforced,
per-position and single-name sizing unaffected.

New tests in `tests/test_risk_based_sizing.py` reproduce the exact defect
(a `NUCLEAR`-cluster set of four requests, `existing_risk_pct=None`,
`clusters` present) — confirmed to fail against the reverted (OR) condition
with only two of four names surviving the wrongly-applied cluster cap, and
to pass against the fix with all four surviving — plus a companion test on
`_book_risk_inputs` documenting the `(None, clusters)` return shape
directly.

### 2026-09-04 — drawdown brakes rescaled to the real per-trade risk unit

**In plain words.** docs/WORK.md item 32 found the ratified 5% per-trade
risk envelope was never actually reachable — an old 20% notional cap
(`risk.max_position_pct`) bound first and suppressed real delivered risk
to ~1.0-1.8% (PR #258, open). That same audit flagged, but explicitly did
not fix, a second consequence: three "drawdown brake" thresholds were
calibrated against that old ~1% unit and would misfire once #258 makes 5%
the real one —

- `in_drawdown`'s rolling 5-day return check
  (`src/pipeline.py::_compute_recent_performance`): flat `< -3.0`.
- The same function's rolling 20-day check: flat `< -8.0`.
- The 3% daily-loss circuit breaker (`risk.max_daily_loss_pct`, enforced
  in `src/risk/rules.py::RiskRuleEngine.check` /
  `RiskRuleEngine.check_daily_loss`).

All three read, in effect, as "N losing max-size trades in a window" —
3 in 5 days, 3 in a day, 8 in 20 days — under the OLD ~1% unit. Left as
flat literals, they would silently become ~5x too loose relative to that
original intent the moment #258/#259 make 5% the real per-trade risk.

**The fix.** Three new `RiskConfig` fields (`src/config.py`):
`drawdown_5d_risk_multiple`, `drawdown_20d_risk_multiple`,
`daily_loss_risk_multiple` — all default to the pre-existing, UNCHANGED
multipliers (3, 8, 3). Two new derived properties,
`drawdown_5d_threshold_pct` / `drawdown_20d_threshold_pct`, compute
`-(multiple x max_position_risk_pct)` and are what
`_compute_recent_performance` now reads instead of the old hardcoded
`-3.0` / `-8.0`. `max_daily_loss_pct` keeps the exact override pattern
`max_sector_hard_pct` already uses one field up: an explicit value always
wins (kept for the ~50 existing tests/fixtures across this repo that set
it to an arbitrary literal for unrelated reasons); absent one, a new
`effective_max_daily_loss_pct` property derives
`daily_loss_risk_multiple x max_position_risk_pct`. `RiskRuleEngine`'s two
daily-loss checks and the two read-only display paths
(`src/api/routes_live.py`, `src/pipeline.py`'s notifier payload) now read
the effective property, not the raw field.

`config/settings.yaml` sets `max_daily_loss_pct: 15` (= 3 x 5, was 3),
`daily_loss_risk_multiple: 3`, `drawdown_5d_risk_multiple: 3`,
`drawdown_20d_risk_multiple: 8` — the 5-day/20-day thresholds are no
longer separately configured percentages at all, only the multipliers
are, so they cannot drift from the risk unit the way the daily-loss field
could.

**What is derived versus what is inherited, stated precisely because this
desk holds "no arbitrary numbers" as a standard (docs/OUTCOME.md).** The
UNIT conversion is real: old ~1.0-1.8% delivered risk and the new 5%
`max_position_risk_pct` are both documented, measured/ratified figures
(see the 2026-09-04 notional-cap entry above), and every threshold here is
now expressed as a multiple of that unit rather than a flat percent. The
multiplier N (3 for daily and 5-day, 8 for 20-day) is NOT re-derived —
it is carried over from the pre-existing, never independently validated
constant, because there is no measured drawdown/track-record history to
check it against: the 2026-09-02 clean-slate reset wiped the equity curve
these checks read, and per the #258 incident entry the 20-day check in
particular cannot evaluate at all yet for lack of 20 real trading days of
history since. This is flagged PROVISIONAL in docs/WORK.md item 32,
explicitly an owner decision once real post-fix drawdown data exists —
not decided or guessed at here.

**Sequencing dependency, stated plainly.** These settings.yaml values are
sized for the state PRs #258/#259 create (`max_position_risk_pct`
actually delivering 5% real risk), not the state main is in today. Merging
this change ahead of #258/#259 would loosen the brakes roughly 5x while
real per-trade risk is still the suppressed ~1-1.8% — this PR must land
after #258 and #259, not before.

**Tests.** New file `tests/test_drawdown_brake_rescale.py` (11 tests, all
new — no existing test exercised this threshold arithmetic before): the
two `RiskConfig` derivation properties at two different risk-unit values
(pins the rescaling behaviour, not just one static number);
`effective_max_daily_loss_pct`'s explicit-wins and derives-when-unset
paths; `RiskRuleEngine.check_daily_loss` with a concrete regression case
(a 10% daily loss that would have tripped the old flat 3% breaker no
longer trips at the derived 15%, a 16% loss still does) plus the explicit-
override path; `TradingPipeline._compute_recent_performance` with
concrete 5-day and 20-day regression cases showing a move that would have
tripped the old hardcoded -3.0/-8.0 no longer trips at the derived
-15%/-40%, and a deeper move still does; and a
`PortfolioManagerAgent.build_user_message` case confirming the prompt now
renders the actual configured thresholds rather than the old hand-typed
"5d < -3% OR 20d < -8%" string (also fixed in
`src/agents/portfolio_manager.py`, the one prompt-facing surface that
restated the numbers rather than just echoing computed values — threaded
through via two new `_compute_recent_performance` return keys,
`drawdown_5d_threshold_pct` / `drawdown_20d_threshold_pct`). Full suite:
4799 passed / 1 skipped / 1 failed before this change, 4810 passed / 1
skipped / 1 failed after (net +11, all new; the 1 failure is
`test_rehearsal_reproduces_cost_ceiling.py`, the same pre-existing,
environment-dependent failure PR #258 also excluded from its counts —
unrelated to this change, fails identically before and after it).

See PR `fix/drawdown-brake-rescale` (open, not merged — depends on
#258/#259 landing first, needs independent adversarial review before
merge, same posture as every other risk-touching change this week).

### 2026-09-04 — the notional cap, not the 5% envelope, was the real per-trade risk limit

**In plain words.** The owner ratified "risk up to 5% of the book per
trade" on 2026-08-27. A much older, unrelated rule — "never put more than
20% of the book's notional value in one name" — sat in front of it in the
order the constructor applies clamps, and bound first almost every time.
`notional = risk_pct x entry / (entry - stop)`, so a 20% notional ceiling
caps DELIVERED risk to `20% x stop_distance` regardless of what conviction
asked for. At this desk's real stop distances (roughly 5-9%, after the
2026-08-27 ATR-floor fix), that ceiling delivered ~1.0-1.8% risk no matter
whether the PM asked for 1% or 5%. Real-data audit tonight: 6 of 13 real
proposed orders pinned at exactly 20% notional; a 2.8%-risk request and a
1.0%-risk request both delivered ~1% risk either way. The 5% figure was
ratified but never actually reachable — closing this gap is catch-up on an
already-made decision, not a new one.

Compounding it: the PM prompt's conviction-to-risk-% bands
(`config/prompts/portfolio_manager.md`, Step 5) were tuned DOWN on
2026-08-27 (high 2.0-4.0% -> 1.5-3.0%, moderate 1.0-2.5% -> 1.0-2.0%,
commit `19641f5`) specifically to fit under this wrongly-binding 20%
ceiling, rather than the cap being sized to the mandate. And the
drawdown-response rules (`in_drawdown` in `src/pipeline.py`: 5-day <-3% or
20-day <-8% halves size; the 3% daily-loss circuit breaker in
`src/risk/rules.py`/`settings.yaml`) are April-2026-era constants
calibrated to a desk risking a fraction of a percent per trade — under the
real ~1% delivered risk they were already too easy to trip relative to
normal trade variance, and would be more so once real risk moves toward 5%.

**The fix shipped tonight.** `risk.max_position_pct` (settings.yaml) moved
20 -> 100, mirrored in `ConstructorConfig.max_position_pct`
(`src/portfolio_constructor.py`) and the pipeline's fallback default. 100
is derived from this desk's own real numbers, not picked: at the tight end
of the documented real range (5%), 5% risk needs `5 / 5 x 100 = 100%`
notional — and since `allow_margin` is false, 100% of one name's equity is
already the real reachable ceiling regardless of the number configured
here, so 100 covers the real range without inventing headroom that was
never usable. A stop tighter than 5% — reachable today only via the
level-backed exception down to `absolute_min_stop_atr_multiple` — still
gets clamped, which is exactly the "genuinely too tight" case this ceiling
exists for rather than the ordinary one. Full derivation in the
settings.yaml and portfolio_constructor.py comments at that setting.

**Interaction with the other ceilings, checked before shipping.**
`max_portfolio_risk_pct` (25%, the book-wide risk ceiling) is enforced by
`allocate_risk_budget` BEFORE the single-name notional clamp ever runs in
`_build_buy`/`_build_short`, and does not read `max_position_pct` at all —
raising the notional cap cannot raise total book risk past 25%. Pinned as
a test:
`test_raising_the_single_name_notional_cap_does_not_raise_the_total_risk_ceiling`
in `tests/test_risk_based_sizing.py`. One real interaction the fix
surfaced (not caused): `max_sector_hard_pct` (90%, spec §12.3, unchanged)
is an ABSOLUTE per-sector ceiling that applies even to a single, uncrowded
name — since 90 sits below the new 100, it now binds ahead of the
single-name cap whenever an isolated position in a real sector asks for
more than 90% notional. A 5%-risk/5%-stop request, for example, lands on
90% notional (4.5% delivered risk) rather than the full 100%/5%. That is a
different, already-ratified, unchanged ceiling doing its own job — not a
gap this fix opened, and not touched, per instruction not to move sector
caps without their own independent review. `max_single_short_pct` (10%)
was historically "half of max_position_pct" when both were chosen at
20/10; that relationship is now stale (shorts were out of scope for this
fix and were not scaled with it) — the comments at that setting
(settings.yaml, src/config.py) now say so explicitly rather than leaving
the old, now-inaccurate "deliberately half" framing in place.

**NOT shipped tonight — a genuine design fork, not decided here.** The
conviction bands and the drawdown brakes both need re-deriving now the
notional cap is fixed, but two materially different, both-defensible
designs disagree on how:

- **(a) Widen the bands back** toward their original 2.0-4.0% / 1.0-2.5%
  numbers, and re-scale the drawdown brakes as multiples of the real
  per-trade risk unit (the standard "N consecutive losing R's cuts size"
  convention) — restoring what 2026-08-27 compressed, now that the thing
  it was compressed for no longer applies.
- **(b) An explicit volatility-parity overlay.** Size each trade to a
  similar risk-CONTRIBUTION via its own ATR — standard CTA/managed-futures
  practice — on top of what `notional = risk_pct x entry/(entry-stop)`
  already does. Note for whoever picks this apart next: the stop is
  already ATR-derived (`risk.min_stop_atr_multiple`), so (a) already
  carries a form of volatility scaling through the stop-distance
  denominator; (b) would be a SEPARATE overlay on top of that, and risks
  double-counting volatility unless deliberately unified with (a) rather
  than simply added alongside it.

The real long-term answer — sizing risk-per-trade off this desk's own
measured track record via fractional Kelly, using the analyst scorecard
(`src/api/routes_scorecard.py`, `docs/WORK.md` item 29) — is not buildable
honestly yet: that scorecard reports zero resolved calls as of tonight
(started 2026-08-31, timers paused most of that day), and a Kelly figure
derived from too few resolved trades would not be honest either. This is
the correct next step once enough resolved-trade history exists, flagged
here rather than built now.

This is escalated as a genuine fork rather than resolved by picking one,
per this task's own instruction to only escalate a real disagreement in
established practice, not a preference question — (a) and (b) are both
standard and materially disagree on where volatility should enter the
sizing formula. See the pending decision in `docs/WORK.md`. The conviction
bands and drawdown brakes are UNCHANGED pending that call.

**Also noted, not a new defect.** The 20-day drawdown rule
(`rolling_20d_pct`) cannot evaluate yet regardless of which design wins —
the equity-curve history it reads was wiped by the deliberate 2026-09-02
clean-slate reset, and there has not been 20 trading days of real
evening-close rows since. Expected; it starts evaluating once that history
accumulates.

Tests: `tests/test_risk_based_sizing.py` — the single-name-ceiling section
rewritten to use the real 100 default (mechanism tests that need a tight
cap for isolation now pass one explicitly), plus three new tests: the
realistic-stop-distance case no longer flattening conviction, a genuinely
too-tight stop still binding (via the sector ceiling in practice), and the
total-risk ceiling holding regardless of the raised notional cap. Also
fixed two unrelated existing tests (`test_the_budget_gate_is_inert_when_
the_caller_supplies_no_book_risk`,
`test_a_heat_failure_leaves_the_budget_unenforced_even_with_clusters`)
whose fixture happened to put four same-sector names at a size large
enough, post-fix, to hit the (real, unrelated) sector hard cap — loosened
the sector config in those two tests to keep them isolated to what they
actually test. `tests/test_prompts_anchors.py` anchor updated to the new
100% wording. Full suite: `tests/test_config.py`,
`tests/test_correlation_risk.py`, `tests/test_event_risk_calendar.py`,
`tests/test_phase2_risk_wiring.py`, `tests/test_pipeline.py`,
`tests/test_pipeline_context.py`, `tests/test_pipeline_stages.py`,

`tests/test_risk_metrics.py`, `tests/test_risk_outcome_logging.py`,
`tests/test_risk_rules.py`, `tests/test_risk_verdict_per_symbol.py`: 520
passed before this change, 522 after (net +2: one test renamed in place,
two added). Risk/sector/exposure suite
(`tests/test_risk_rules.py`, `tests/test_sector_dial.py`,

unaffected.

independent adversarial review before merge, same posture as every other
risk-touching change tonight).

### 2026-09-04 — opportunity-cost rotation: capital could sit in a weak holding while a stronger idea got refused for "no room" (item 39)

**In plain words.** The desk has a hard rule that total risk across the book
can't exceed 25% of equity, and a related rule capping how much correlated
names can carry together. Both rules are working as designed — they correctly
say no to a new trade once the book is full. But neither one, nor anything
else, ever asked the follow-up question: is the new idea actually BETTER than
something the book is already holding? A desk that is fully committed to
weak, stale, or barely-justified positions could refuse a genuinely stronger
new idea for no reason other than "no room", with nothing anywhere comparing
the two. This was a real, owner-identified gap, not a bug in existing code —
nothing was broken; a capability the owner wanted simply did not exist yet.

**What was built.** A new module, `src/rotation.py`, and a new prompt section
in the Portfolio Manager's own briefing (`PortfolioManagerAgent
._render_rotation_section`, wired into `build_user_message`). Every session,
Technical already re-reads the whole configured universe — held positions
included — so the existing candidate ranking (`src/verdicts.py::rank_verdicts`,
item 31) already places held names and new candidates on one shared scale
without any change needed there. The new logic asks two questions, in order:

1. **Is capital actually constrained right now?** Computed from the book's
   EXISTING risk alone (before anything this session proposes), using the
   same `allocate_risk_budget` function the risk ceiling itself already runs
   on (`src/risk/budget.py`). If real headroom is left — enough for at least
   one more minimum-sized position — nothing is surfaced at all. This was a
   deliberate design choice: the feature must never activate as a "could we
   do better" nudge on an otherwise fine book, only when refusal is actually
   the reason nothing new can be added.
2. **If constrained, is there a real opportunity being missed?** Two tiers:
   - **Categorical.** A held position that no longer clears the desk's OWN
     entry rules (`PortfolioManagerAgent.candidate_eligibility` — the same
     R/R floor, BUY-eligibility, and evidence checks a brand-new buy must
     pass) needs no ranking margin to flag: it would not be bought today, by
     the identical rule a new buy is held to. This is not a ranking
     judgement, it is a fact about whether today's own rules would open the
     position now.
   - **Ranked margin.** Among held positions that ARE still eligible, a new
     candidate must outrank the weakest held one by a real margin before a
     rotation is surfaced — otherwise the system would churn on marginal,
     noise-level differences in the ranking score every session.

**Why 25%, and why it is marked PROVISIONAL.** This is a well-studied pattern
in systematic and cross-sectional portfolio construction — rank everything on
one scale, replace the weakest holding with a stronger candidate only past a
real margin, specifically to prevent turnover driven by noise rather than a
real edge. Grinold & Kahn's *Active Portfolio Management* formalises this as
a "no-trade region": a rebalance is only worth making once the expected
improvement clears a real breakeven against transaction costs, not at every
marginal rank change. FTSE Russell's own published index-reconstitution
methodology applies the identical shape in live production — a "banding" /
buffer rule that requires a candidate to clear a materially different bar
than an incumbent before a membership swap happens, precisely to damp
turnover from marginal, boundary-level rank changes (FTSE Russell, "Russell
US Indexes Construction and Methodology"; summarised at
https://www.lseg.com/en/insights/ftse-russell — "percentile banding...
allows previous membership to be considered in order to limit unnecessary
index turnover"). Neither source, nor any other found, hands over one
universal number: practitioner discussion of rebalancing tolerance bands
clusters loosely in a 5%-25% relative range depending on the asset and cost
profile (see e.g. Alpha Architect's writing on rebalancing tolerance bands).
This module took the CONSERVATIVE end of that range — 25%, the hardest to
trigger — and marks it PROVISIONAL, the same posture `src/verdicts.py
::SEAT_WEIGHT` (item 31) already uses for its own literature-grounded but
unmeasured numbers: a considered starting point, not a measured fact,
revisable the moment this desk has its own rotation-outcome data to spend.

**What this deliberately does NOT do.** It never edits a position, never
submits an exit, and never changes sizing or eligibility — it is purely a new
paragraph in the Portfolio Manager's own prompt, read by the same AI that
already decides trade choice today. This was a deliberate architecture
choice, not a shortcut: the codebase's existing division of labor is
deterministic Python for eligibility/sizing/ceilings, and the PM's own
judgement for which trade to take. Whether to trim a name is a trade-choice
question, not an eligibility question, so it stays with the PM — the same
reasoning already applied to the Phase 13 candidate ranking (item 31), which
orders candidates but never picks for the PM. If the PM acts on the surfaced
comparison, that action is still an ordinary edit to a held position and
still owes the same substantive justification any other exit does (items
22-24) — the rotation note is information, never a reason on its own.

**Known simplification, flagged rather than solved here.** The check looks
only at the TOTAL portfolio risk ceiling's headroom, not the per-cluster
ceiling or the gross-exposure ladder (`docs/WORK.md` background, spec
§11.2) — both are real, separate ways capital can be constrained, and are
left for a follow-up rather than bundled into this first increment.

**Tests.** `tests/test_rotation.py` — hand-computed scenarios: a
clearly-stronger candidate rotating out a categorically-ineligible holding
(no margin needed) and out of a weak-but-still-eligible one (margin
cleared); a marginal edge that does NOT trigger (and the exact margin
boundary, which does); real headroom suppressing the check entirely, at and
above the floor; and edge cases (nothing held to compare against, an empty
`blocked` reasons list not misread as a categorical hit, and multiple
ineligible holdings resolved deterministically). Full existing suite run
before/after — see the PR for exact counts.

### 2026-09-04 — full technical inventory from the night's three parallel audits

`docs/WORK.md` items 32-35 carry the headline findings from three parallel
audits (entry/eligibility, position sizing/risk budget, exit management/
ranking) run the same night the "no arbitrary numbers" principle was
written down (see `docs/OUTCOME.md`). Those items are deliberately short,
per this file's own size discipline — this entry is the full, unabridged
catalog underneath them: every individual constant found, its
classification (MEASURED / REASONED-DEFAULT-DISCLOSED /
ARBITRARY-UNDISCLOSED), and its real-data doctrine check, so a future
session or agent can find the exact file:line for any one of them without
re-running the audits from scratch.

**Full detail preserved verbatim in this session's own memory** at
`qamc-full-audit-inventory-2026-09-04.md` — three ranked tables (one per
audit) plus the "passes review, wrong in practice" findings from each.
Key items already resolved same night, for quick reference:

- Entry: two disjoint reward:risk gates unified (PR #257); smart-money
  cluster window 14→2 days to match cited research (PR #260); PM
  conviction bands restored after being compressed to fit an unrelated,
  since-fixed cap (PR #259).
- Sizing: single-name notional cap raised from an unratified 20% to a
  value derived from this desk's own real stop distances (PR #258);
  portfolio-level volatility-targeting was investigated and explicitly
  REJECTED as importing the wrong mandate (a fund's smoothness goal, not
  a trader's survival goal) — see `qamc-no-fund-style-sizing.md`.
- Exit/ranking: noise-veto band now scales with √(days held) instead of a
  flat multiplier; ranking ties now break on real reward:risk quality
  instead of alphabetically; range-setup positions now get a standard
  +1R breakeven ratchet instead of zero protection until full target (all
  three: PR #256).

**Not yet fixed, real and open** (ranked, full detail in the memory file):
undisclosed drift-detection thresholds and a fixed-50%-reduce rule in
exit management; decorative/duplicate day-count tiers in the Risk
Manager's own maturity labels; short-selling limits that need
re-deriving now the notional cap changed; whether the drawdown brakes
need rescaling to the new real per-trade risk unit (a genuine open fork,
not decided); the smart-money minimum-dollar filter, which needs insider
holdings-size data this desk doesn't fetch yet; and a long tail of
individually-cheap prompt-level folklore (extension guards, PE
thresholds, stale-day counts) in the technical analyst's own prompt.

**Also from the same stretch:** the two "real-looking" API keys in
production `.env` (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`) were found to be
the literal, unmodified placeholder text from this project's own
`.env.example` (added by the original developer 2026-05-08 when
open-sourcing the repo) — never real credentials, never exposed. Fixed
on the box with an explanatory comment so this doesn't get re-investigated
as a false alarm again. Separately, GitHub Pages was enabled for this repo
(public, `main`/`docs`), so anything added to `docs/` renders at
`https://redstonex.github.io/quant-agent/<filename>` automatically.

**Real, still-open decision, not resolved here:** whether to add a live
congressional (US House/Senate) trading data stream to the smart-money
seat. Investigated 2026-09-04: no free, currently-reliable option exists.
The two well-known free aggregator projects (house-stock-watcher,
senate-stock-watcher) are both dead — one's domain no longer resolves, the
other's last real data commit was 2021 despite its own page still
claiming to be live. One brand-new free alternative surfaced the same
week but is unverified, single-maintainer, no track record. Real options
are: adopt the unproven free source and accept the risk, build in-house
PDF parsing against the official House/Senate disclosures (real
engineering cost, the House side is still scanned/mixed-format PDFs, not
clean text), or pay for a commercial feed (Quiver Quantitative is the
most API-native paid option). Owner's call — this is a new-dependency /
reliability tradeoff, not something to adopt unilaterally.

### 2026-09-04 — merge order for tonight's open PRs (they share files, not logic)

Eleven PRs from tonight's session are open at once (#249, #252, #254-#262).
None conflict in what they DO — each is independently reviewed and correct
on its own — but several share the same files, so merging them in the
wrong order (or all at once) will produce ordinary git conflicts, not
logic bugs. Recorded here so this isn't only in one session's head before
a compaction erases it.

**Known file-sharing collisions, confirmed by reading the actual diffs:**
- `src/agents/portfolio_manager.py`: shared by #257 (reward:risk gate
  unification) and #261 (opportunity-cost rotation).
- `config/prompts/portfolio_manager.md`: shared by #259 (conviction-band
  restore) and #261 (opportunity-cost rotation).
- `docs/WORK.md` / `docs/INCIDENT_HISTORY.md`: shared by nearly all of
  them, as usual for this project — the established convention (keep
  both sides, reconcile headers/separators) applies same as always.
- #261 also branched slightly before the diagram rename landed (#253) —
  it will try to re-add `docs/verdict_pipeline.html` under its old name;
  a rebase onto current `main` resolves this automatically, it is not a
  real content conflict.

**Recommended order, since #258/#259 are already sequential (259 is based
on 258's branch) and #257/#261 touch the PM directly:**
1. Merge #249, #252, #254, #255, #260 first — no shared-file overlap with
   anything else in the list, safe to land independently once reviewed.
2. Merge #258, then #259 (already built on top of it).
3. Merge #257 next (PM eligibility fix).
4. Rebase #261 onto the result, resolve the small PM-file overlap with
   #257 and the diagram-filename artifact, then merge.
5. #256 and #262 don't share files with the PM-touching group — safe to
   land in parallel with steps 2-4 once independently reviewed.

None of this changes what any PR does — it is purely the order to avoid
avoidable merge conflicts. If a session resumes cold and some of these
are already merged, this list is stale for whichever ones are done —
check `gh pr list` for the real current state before following it blindly.

### 2026-09-04 — earnings stopped transcribing and started concluding (item 18c)

**In plain words:** the earnings seat used to hand the Portfolio Manager a
complete extraction form for every filing — revenue, margins, guidance,
strategy, competitive positioning, strategic risks, operational risks, data
quality — ending in one line of actual judgement. That form was ~1,400
characters per filing, and across the ~35 companies it covers on a normal
day it was 70% of PM's entire 200,000-character prompt (item 18, measured
2026-09-02) and a large share of why that one seat was 93% of the LLM bill
(item 14). PM was doing the analyst's own summarizing work, at PM's LLM
price, on every call. Every other analyst seat already hands PM a
conclusion, not raw extraction — earnings was the outlier. Owner-ratified
fix, not a design question: return a call and a short thesis, keep the full
extraction on disk for audit.

**What changed.**

- `config/prompts/earnings_analyst.md`: `key_thesis` is now specified as
  the field PM actually reads — 2-3 sentences stating the call, the single
  strongest reason from the reasoning chain, and the condition that would
  break it (pulled from whichever of `bull_case`/`bear_case` falsifies the
  stated `sentiment`). The eight extraction fields are unchanged in shape
  and are still required in full — they no longer reach PM, but
  `position_reviewer`, `evening_analyst`, `meta_reflector`, and a human
  pulling the record for audit still read them straight off disk.
- `src/agents/earnings_analyst.py`: the per-filing result dict
  (`_analyze_one`, both the fresh-analysis and cached-analysis branches) now
  carries `analysis_path` — the pointer PM's short verdict needs to name
  where the full extraction lives. This didn't exist on the wrapper before;
  `EarningsReport.analysis_path` existed but nothing threaded it through to
  the pipeline's `earnings_results` list PM actually receives.
- `src/agents/portfolio_manager.py`: the earnings section of
  `build_user_message` (previously ~70 lines rendering all eight fields
  per filing) now renders four lines — `Call: <sentiment> (<conviction>)`,
  `Thesis: <key_thesis>`, `Invalidated if: <falsifier>`, and a pointer to
  the full extraction. It reuses `EarningsAnalysis.to_verdict()` — the same
  Phase 13 / item 31 shape already used to rank candidates — rather than
  building a second, different short-form representation of the same
  report. `to_verdict()`'s own validator (`AnalystVerdict`) refuses to
  construct a directional call with no stated invalidation, which is
  correct for a ranking score (an unfalsifiable call should not win a
  ranking slot) but wrong for a PROMPT (PM should see the seat's read even
  when the analyst left `bull_case`/`bear_case` at "not disclosed" — a
  degraded citation, not a missing one). `_render_earnings_verdict` falls
  back to the raw `investment_implications` fields and an explicit
  "not disclosed by the analyst" note in that case, rather than dropping
  the filing from PM's prompt.

**Measured, same method as the original 199,646-char figure**: render
`PortfolioManagerAgent.build_user_message` over the real run-64290730 pull
(`ops/model_policy/fixtures/run_64290730_pm_input.json`) and isolate the
`## Earnings Analysis` section. **Before: 205,607 chars total, 140,106
earnings (68.1%). After: 98,351 chars total, 32,850 earnings (33.4%).** The
205,607/140,106 figures track the originally-reported 199,646/140,107
production numbers closely (this is a rendered-fixture reconstruction, not
the live production prompt itself — see `ops/model_policy/README.md`'s
documented ~91% fidelity gap) but are not identical, which is expected and
not a new discrepancy. Earnings analysis is still the single largest
section of the prompt after this change — the volume is real (~35
filings/day), only the per-filing verbosity was fixed here.

**Tests.** `tests/test_earnings_analyst.py`:
`test_analyze_reports_wrapper_carries_analysis_path_to_full_extraction` and
`test_existing_analysis_wrapper_also_carries_analysis_path` prove the full
eight-field extraction is still computed, still saved to disk, and still
locatable from the wrapper dict for both the fresh and cached branches.
`tests/test_portfolio_manager.py`:
`test_earnings_section_renders_short_verdict_not_the_eight_field_form`
proves the rendered PM prompt carries the short verdict and none of the
old form labels (`Filing metrics:`, `Competitive positioning:`, etc.), and
that the section is under 700 characters instead of ~1,400+;
`test_earnings_section_falls_back_when_falsifier_undisclosed` proves the
fallback path when `to_verdict()` refuses construction.

**Exact suite counts** (branch merged onto main at item 28's fix, so the
comparison is apples-to-apples): the earnings/PM-focused slice —
`tests/test_earnings_analyst.py`, `test_portfolio_manager.py`,
`test_earnings_deep_dive.py`, `test_earnings_preprocess.py`,
`test_analyst_verdict.py` — went from **130 passed** (pre-change) to
**134 passed** (post-change, the 4 new tests above, zero regressions).
Full repo suite (excluding files this sandbox cannot even collect —
`test_api_*`, `test_status_board.py` — all `ModuleNotFoundError:
fastapi`, a missing dependency in this sandbox unrelated to this change):
**4,438 passed, 1 skipped, 1 failed** — the 1 failure
(`test_rehearsal_reproduces_cost_ceiling.py::
test_rehearsal_reproduces_2026_08_28_pm_cost_ceiling_failure`,
`MissingRecordedResponse` for a replay fixture) reproduces identically
against unmodified current main, confirmed by running it there directly —
pre-existing and unrelated to earnings or PM prompt assembly, not
introduced by this change.

**Known gap, not resolved here:** earnings runs `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`
(Google-direct), chosen and verified for the transcription task this item
is replacing — this item's own "the cheap-model verdict is now invalid"
finding above applies directly: concluding is a harder task than
extracting, and this environment has no `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to run the
redesigned prompt against the real production model before opening the PR.
Needs a live check on real recent filings before merge.

See PR opened from `feat/earnings-analyst-concludes` (not merged — needs
independent adversarial review, same posture as items 18a/18b/28).

**2026-09-04 follow-up — the live check was attempted and is still blocked,
plus a real finding about how credentials work on this box.** A later pass
fetched three real, current filings straight from SEC EDGAR (AAPL, MU, UNH
10-Qs) and ran the actual redesigned earnings agent against them — but the
call failed before reaching the model. `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in production
`.env` is not a real key by design: it is a placeholder, and the real
credential is injected transparently by the OneCLI gateway proxy at call
time (same pattern as Alpaca's keys). Reading `.env` directly and calling
Google's API without going through that proxy will always fail, regardless
of environment. The model-quality check therefore still needs to run
through the real OneCLI-proxied path (as the production desk itself does),
not a direct `.env` read — this is still open, not a pass or a fail.

**2026-09-04 second follow-up — the live check actually succeeded, this
note above is now stale.** An independent adversarial reviewer confirmed
the OneCLI proxy at `127.0.0.1:10255` is reachable from this box right
now, authenticated through it using the real production call path, and
ran a real, current AAPL 10-Q from SEC EDGAR through the redesigned
prompt against the live `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` model. Output was
coherent: correct real numbers pulled from the filing, a sensible
`sentiment`/`conviction`, and a `key_thesis` that reads as an actual
analytical call. This is n=1, not a validated sample across the ~35
filings/day this seat actually covers — do not treat it as a full
model-quality sign-off — but it does answer the specific open question
above: the redesigned prompt produces usable output on the production
model when the proxy is reachable. PR #252 merged 2026-09-04 on this
basis. Caveat: this box's proxy credential may differ from production's;
if a live desk run ever produces degraded earnings verdicts, re-check
this rather than assume the n=1 result generalizes.

### 2026-09-04 — Congress (House + Senate) trading data added to smart-money, dual-sourced and cross-checked

The "both known aggregators are dead" read recorded above (item 36,
`docs/WORK.md`) was stale. Re-checked live 2026-09-04 and found two
different free, credentialless, currently-updating sources:

- **Primary**: `kadoa-org/congress-trading-monitor` (GitHub, MIT licensed).
  Static JSON, no auth, no rate limit.
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kadoa-org/congress-trading-monitor/main/public/data/trades.json`
  (capped at a 5,000-row recent slice) and per-ticker files at
  `.../data/ticker/{SYMBOL}.json`. Verified live: real, current (as of
  today) House Clerk PTR, Senate eFD and OGE executive-branch rows, with a
  real `filing_date` per trade.
- **Secondary/cross-check**: `congresswatch.us` (OpenSourcePatents LLC).
  `https://congresswatch.us/data/trades.json` (308-redirects to
  `www.congresswatch.us`; ~8,000 records, House + Senate). Verified live.
  Two real data-quality issues confirmed by inspecting the live feed
  directly, not assumed from the spec: (1) its schema carries **no
  filing/disclosure-date field at all** — only `transaction_date` and the
  `ptr_link` to the official PDF; (2) it contains at least one record with
  a transaction dated **2026-12-26**, months in the future relative to
  today (2026-09-04) — confirmed present in the live pull used to build
  this feature, not a hypothetical.

**What was built** — `src/data/congressional_trading.py`:
- `CongressionalTradingProvider` implements the same `SmartMoneySource`
  protocol (`refresh()`/`fetch()`) as `SECForm4Provider`, with the same
  fail-open posture: either source being unreachable, timing out, or
  returning a malformed/unexpected JSON shape degrades to that source's
  last good on-disk cache (or an empty list on a first-ever run) and is
  recorded as a `status: "partial"` result — it never raises, never blocks
  the other source, and never blocks the rest of the smart-money pipeline
  or the run. Verified with tests that kill each source independently and
  both at once (`tests/test_congressional_trading.py`).
- **Dedup**: rows from both sources are grouped by
  `(ticker, normalized filer name, transaction_date)` — name normalization
  strips titles ("Rep.", "Sen.", "Hon.", etc.) and casefolds so "Rep. Kevin
  Hern" and "Kevin Hern" match. Amount is deliberately NOT part of the
  group key: a genuine disagreement about the dollar bracket is exactly
  what the cross-check exists to surface, not a reason to treat two feeds'
  reports of the same trade as two different trades.
- **Disagreement flagging**: within a matched group, if the two sources
  disagree on direction (purchase/sale/exchange) or their amount brackets
  don't overlap, the merged row is marked
  `cross_source_agreement="discrepancy"` with a human-readable
  `cross_source_note` naming what disagreed (both new fields on
  `SmartMoneyObservation`, `src/models.py`, default `""` so every existing
  SEC Form 4 row and any congressional row cached before this shipped
  still validates unchanged). The row is kept either way — a disagreement
  is never a reason to drop a trade, only to flag it. When only one source
  has the trade, it is marked `"single_source"`; when both agree,
  `"agreement"`. kadoa is treated as primary on a disagreement (real
  `filing_date`, more structured feed) but the disagreement itself is
  never hidden.
- **Missing disclosure date (congresswatch-only trades)**: since
  congresswatch carries no filing-date field, a congresswatch-only trade's
  disclosure date is estimated at `transaction_date + 45 days` (capped at
  today) — the same statutory ~45-day congressional disclosure ceiling
  already documented in `src/agents/smart_money_analyst.py`'s module
  docstring, reused rather than invented. This is a conservative
  worst-case assumption (never claims a trade was disclosed sooner than
  the law allows, never mis-states freshness upward) and is called out
  explicitly in code comments, not silently baked in.
- **Bad-date handling**: `_sane_transaction_date` rejects (drops the row)
  any date in the future or more than 20 years old, rather than clamping
  it to some in-range value — a clamp would fabricate a fake trade date
  that was never actually reported; dropping is the honest failure mode.
  Directly exercises the real future-dated congresswatch record described
  above.
- **Cluster window reuse**: the SEC Form 4 materiality/2-day cluster-window
  reduction (Alldredge & Blank, ~2 days — the 2026-09-04 14->2 day audit
  fix, `docs/RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md:19`) was extracted from
  `SECForm4Provider.fetch` into `src/data/smart_money_cluster.py`
  (`cluster_survivors`/`observation_key`) so it is one shared
  implementation, not two independently-tuned copies. Both providers now
  call the same function with the same `cluster_window_days`,
  `min_cluster_owners` and $ thresholds (`config.smart_money.*`) — a
  future change to the window cannot silently drift between the two
  streams. `SECForm4Provider`'s existing 86 tests in
  `tests/test_smart_money.py`/`test_smart_money_verdict.py`/
  `test_insider_signal.py` all still pass unchanged after this
  refactor — confirmed by running them, not assumed.
- **Materiality threshold applied to a bracket, not an exact dollar
  figure**: congressional disclosures are ranges (e.g. "$15,001 -
  $50,000"), not exact amounts. The bracket LOW value is used
  conservatively for `transaction_value_usd` and for materiality
  comparison — this never overstates a trade's size relative to the
  threshold. When both sources report a bracket for the same trade, the
  lower of the two lows is kept (most conservative), separate from
  whether their brackets actually overlap (which drives the discrepancy
  flag above).
- **Congressional data never grows the trading universe**: unlike SEC Form
  4's external-purchase admission lane, `fetch()` only returns
  congressional observations whose symbol is already in the caller's
  configured universe (`admission_eligible`/`transient_admission_eligible`
  are hard-set `False` for every congressional row). The seat's existing
  acceptance contract (`src/agents/smart_money_analyst.py` module
  docstring) ties symbol admission to an exact SEC Form 4 open-market `P`;
  extending that power to congressional disclosures would be new scope
  this task did not ask for and the owner has not reviewed. Congressional
  data stays exactly what the seat's own docstring already called it:
  "primarily thematic/confirmatory context."
- **Wiring**: a new `CombinedSmartMoneyProvider` (same file) fans the
  pipeline's single `smart_money_provider` slot out to both
  `SECForm4Provider` and (when `config.smart_money.congress_enabled`,
  default `False`) `CongressionalTradingProvider`, isolating either
  sub-provider's exception from the other and from the caller — verified
  with a test where one sub-provider raises on both `refresh()` and
  `fetch()` and the other's results still come through cleanly.

**What was NOT done**, deliberately out of scope for this task: no change
to the LLM-facing smart-money prompt or `smart_money_analyst.py` itself —
the existing "conservative congressional contract" in
`SmartMoneyFinding.deterministic_eligibility` (`src/models.py`, requires
>=2 observations, >=2 distinct actors, one direction, all disclosures
<=7 days old and <=30 days lag before a congressional-only finding can
support a PM thesis) already existed for a since-removed prior provider
and needed no changes to accept these new rows; no per-ticker kadoa
endpoint integration (`.../data/ticker/{SYMBOL}.json`) — the top-level
capped `trades.json` file was used for both sources' broad discovery pass,
matching `SECForm4Provider`'s own "broad discovery, cache, then
lookback-filtered fetch" shape, and is sufficient at this desk's current
universe size; no attempt to resolve `owner`/joint-filer detail
(spouse/dependent trades) beyond what each source already reports as a
single row.

**Exact suite counts** (both runs on this same sandbox, full repo suite,
excluding files this sandbox cannot even collect — `test_api_*`,
`test_status_board.py`, all `ModuleNotFoundError: fastapi`, a missing
dependency here unrelated to this change): unmodified origin/main
(28b955d, run in a separate disposable worktree) — **1 failed, 4908
passed, 1 skipped**; this branch — **1 failed, 4922 passed, 1 skipped**
(the 14 new tests in `tests/test_congressional_trading.py` account for
the entire delta — 4922 - 4908 = 14 — confirming zero regressions in the
pre-existing suite). The 1 failure
(`test_rehearsal_reproduces_cost_ceiling.py::
test_rehearsal_reproduces_2026_08_28_pm_cost_ceiling_failure`,
`MissingRecordedResponse` for a replay fixture) reproduces byte-identically
against unmodified origin/main — pre-existing, unrelated to this change,
not introduced by it.

## 2026-09-04 — Congressional-trading feed was throwing away real trades two different ways (found before merge, PR #271)

**In plain words.** The brand-new "what did members of Congress buy and sell"
data feed was quietly losing real trades before anyone could look at them, for
two unrelated reasons. Neither was a crash and neither showed up as an error —
the feed just returned less than it should have, and looked healthy doing it.
Both were caught while the pull request was still open, so nothing broken ever
ran.

**Where the two findings actually came from — not from us.** Someone had
already built a free congressional-trading workflow (an n8n template) and
published his own list of things that bit him. Reading that list is what
surfaced both of these. This matters for the record: these are field reports
from a person who had already run this exact kind of data against the real
disclosure systems, not defects we deduced from first principles or guessed
at. Where a claim of his was load-bearing here, it was checked independently
against the primary source before being acted on (see below).

### Finding 1 — the freshness window was shorter than the law's own deadline

The provider only kept disclosures filed in the last **30 days**.

The STOCK Act gives a member up to **45 days** after a trade to file the
disclosure. So a 30-day window could not cover even the *legal* lag, never
mind real behaviour — and in practice filings cluster at or past the deadline
rather than early. The effect: a genuine, recent, perfectly legitimate trade
that happened to be filed on day 38 was dropped on the floor. Silently. No
error, no counter, no log line — the feed simply returned fewer rows.

Verified independently rather than taken on the workflow author's word: the
45-day statutory ceiling was re-confirmed 2026-09-04 against the House
Committee on Ethics' own PTR instructions and the Senate Select Committee on
Ethics' PTR instructions, both of which state the "no later than 45 days after
the transaction" rule directly. The 45-day number was already in this repo
(`smart_money_analyst.py`'s module docstring, and the provider's own
`assumed_max_disclosure_lag_days`) — the bug was that the *retention* window
had been set below a number the same codebase already knew.

**Now 180 days.** Not an invented figure: it is the default that comparable
free tool's author settled on, for exactly this reason, after a short window
returned almost nothing for him. It is generous on purpose — this is a
*coverage* window, deciding what the analyst is allowed to see at all, not a
*strength* window deciding what counts as evidence.

**What was deliberately NOT changed, and why it matters:**

* **SEC Form 4's own window stays tight (7 days config / 14 days provider).**
  Form 4 has a ~2-business-day filing deadline — a completely different
  statute with a completely different lag profile. Widening it to match the
  congressional one would be exactly the wrong lesson to draw. There is now a
  test that asserts the two windows are different and that the Form 4 one is
  the smaller, so a future "tidy-up" cannot quietly harmonise them.
* **The eligibility contract stays at 7 days.**
  `SmartMoneyFinding.deterministic_eligibility` still requires congressional-
  only evidence to be >=2 observations, >=2 distinct members, one direction,
  and every disclosure <=7 days old. A 180-day coverage window therefore
  cannot make stale data load-bearing — it only stops fresh data being binned
  before it is ever assessed. There is a test asserting exactly that.

**Related tension noted, NOT fixed here** (flagging, not self-authorising):
that same contract also requires `lag_days <= 30`, i.e. the gap between the
trade and its disclosure must be under 30 days. Since the statute permits 45,
a trade disclosed legally at day 40 can never support a thesis under the
current contract no matter how fresh the disclosure is. That may well be
intentional conservatism, but it is an owner-level judgment about what counts
as evidence, not a bug to be quietly widened by whoever happens to be in the
file. Left exactly as it was.

### Finding 2 — direction parsing did not understand the disclosure form's own codes

The function turning a raw transaction-type value into buy/sell/exchange only
matched full words: anything starting "purchase", "sale" or "exchange".
Everything else became `"unknown"`.

But the House Periodic Transaction Report form does not use full words. It
uses **short codes**:

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `P` | Purchase |
| `S` | Sale (full) |
| `S (partial)` | Partial sale — only part of a holding sold |
| `E` | Exchange (rare; e.g. a share swap in a merger) |

Every row carrying a short code was read as direction-unknown. For a data
source whose entire reason to exist is knowing *which way* a member traded,
that is not a cosmetic gap — it is the signal being deleted. It also polluted
the cross-source check: one feed rendering "Sale" and the other rendering "S"
for the same real trade would have been flagged as the two sources
*disagreeing about direction*, which is a false alarm on the one signal the
cross-check exists to raise honestly.

**Source for the code set, since it is now load-bearing.** Confirmed
2026-09-04 against the House Committee on Ethics' financial-disclosure
instruction guide and the House Clerk's published PTR forms, plus the Senate
Select Committee on Ethics' PTR instructions — which between them define
exactly three reportable transaction kinds (purchase, sale, exchange), the
partial-sale qualifier, and the single-letter codes above. The full-word and
`sale_full`/`sale_partial` snake_case renderings are the forms the two live
feeds and the widely-mirrored House-Clerk-derived JSON schema actually emit.

**Now an explicit allowlist, not a loose match.** The obvious cheap fix — "if
it starts with `s`, call it a sale" — is worse than the bug: it would read
"Stock Split" and "Stock Dividend" as sales, i.e. invent a sell signal out of
a corporate action. Short codes are therefore matched only as an exact whole
token; full-word prefix matching is kept as a fallback for qualifiers we have
not enumerated. There are tests for both, including one asserting "Stock
Split" stays unknown.

**And the class of bug is now visible instead of silent.** Anything that still
matches nothing is recorded in a module-level set and logged once per distinct
value, with the offending raw string and where to add it. The original
failure mode was not really "short codes were missing" — it was that an
unrecognized value produced no trace at all, so a future upstream format
change would have degraded the feed exactly as invisibly. That is the part
that is actually fixed.

**Exact suite counts** (both runs on this sandbox, full repo suite,
same collection exclusions as the entry above): PR #271 head before these
fixes (`7c9d0fd`, run in a separate disposable worktree) — **1 failed, 4922
passed, 1 skipped**; this branch after the fixes — **1 failed, 4953 passed,
1 skipped**. `tests/test_congressional_trading.py` goes from **14 to 45
tests** (+31), which accounts for the entire delta (4953 - 4922 = 31),
confirming zero regressions in the pre-existing suite. The subsequent
`origin/main` merge on this branch touched `docs/WORK.md` only — no code —
so those counts stand. The 1 failure
is `test_rehearsal_reproduces_cost_ceiling.py::
test_rehearsal_reproduces_2026_08_28_pm_cost_ceiling_failure`, reproduced
byte-identically against the unmodified PR head in a separate worktree —
pre-existing, unrelated, not introduced here.

### 2026-09-04 — six real alternatives to the shipped congressional-data sources, checked and rejected

**In plain words.** After PR #271 wired in two free sources (kadoa-org/
congress-trading-monitor as primary, congresswatch.us as cross-check),
the owner found several other candidates via real Reddit search and
asked for each to be checked properly rather than assumed. All six were
tested directly, not just read about. None beat what's already shipped.
Recorded here so a future session doesn't re-spend time re-checking the
same six.

**1. A solo developer's "Politician Trades API" on RapidAPI** (real
Reddit thread, r/SideProject, confirmed legitimate by genuine community
comments). Live, real backend confirmed via RapidAPI gateway responses.
**Rejected: House-only by design** — the author deliberately excluded
the Senate over its stricter data-usage notice. A source missing half
of Congress is worse than no source. Free-tier quota unverified (would
need a RapidAPI account to confirm), moot given the disqualifier.

**2. "Congressional Intel" (congress.osi-cyber.com).** Real, live site;
its real backend API was found and tested directly (`/api/v1/public/*`
endpoints). **Rejected on multiple independent grounds:**
- Its headline claim — filings detected within 2-3 days vs. a 45-day
  industry standard — is contradicted by **its own API**:
  `/public/stats` reports a real average detection time of 38 days.
- Its actual differentiator (conflict-of-interest scoring) is entirely
  paywalled — every scoring field returns the literal string
  `"*** Upgrade to Premium ***"` on the free tier.
- The free `/public/trades` endpoint is capped at 3 rows, ignores its
  own ticker filter (`?ticker=NVDA` returned an unrelated P&G trade),
  and has no pagination.
- Real data-quality defects found: 91 of 238 politician names use a
  different name-order convention than the other 147 (no
  normalization), 33 have a null party, and at least one real person
  (Sen. John Curtis) is split into two disconnected records with
  divided trade histories.
- One genuinely useful free thing, noted for future use, NOT as a data
  source: `/api/v1/transparency/freshness` — a free, independent
  cross-check of whether a congressional-data pipeline (any pipeline,
  including ours) has gone stale, since it reports its own last-seen
  disclosure dates per chamber.

**3. Stocknest (stocknest.app).** **Rejected — not a User-Agent
problem.** Every path returns a genuine Cloudflare interactive
JS-challenge response (`cf-mitigated: challenge`), and its own
`robots.txt` explicitly declares `ai-train=no, use=reference`. Not
machine-accessible, and it asks not to be scraped — respected.

**4. A free n8n workflow template** (r/n8n, "log US Congress stock
trades ... to Google Sheets"). **Not a new source** — its real
underlying data comes from a paid Apify actor (~$0.002/row), just
repackaged into a free automation template. Real value extracted from
it anyway: two ingestion lessons applied as bug fixes to PR #271 (see
below) — the "P" vs "Purchase" transaction-type parsing gap, and the
45-day legal disclosure window meaning a 30-day lookback misses real,
late-but-legitimate filings.

**5. EODHD's Congressional Trades API** (`eodhd.com/financial-apis/
congressional-trades-api`). **Rejected.** The general free tier is
20 API calls/day total across every EODHD product, and congressional
trades specifically returns its own dedicated `403 — plan does not
include Congressional Trades` error code, strongly indicating the
dataset is gated behind a paid tier even before the 20-call ceiling
applies. Each congress-trades call is also billed at 10x the normal
call weight in EODHD's own documented cost table. Could not fully
confirm the exact paid tier required without creating an account.

**6. Equibles (github.com/daniel3303/Equibles), hosted free-tier
angle.** Real, verified free tier on its hosted API: $0/month, 100
requests/day, no card required — the only one of the six with a
genuinely confirmed, uncapped-by-paywall free tier. **Not adopted as a
replacement** (kadoa + congresswatch have no daily cap at all), but
flagged as the strongest candidate for a FUTURE third cross-check.
**Separately, the same project's self-hostable open-source angle
surfaced via a different real Reddit thread (r/datasets, post
`1te2a5z`) and is under active, deeper evaluation as of this entry —
see the dedicated entry below once it lands, or `docs/WORK.md` for its
current status if this entry hasn't been added yet.**

**Also applied to PR #271 from lead #4's real lessons, not invented:**
the transaction-type parser was fixed to recognize STOCK Act short
codes ("P"/"S"/"E") alongside the full words it already handled, and
the default lookback window was widened past the old 30 days to
actually cover the real 45-day legal disclosure lag. Detail in PR
#271's own commits.

### 2026-09-04 — Equibles evaluated as a possible data-infrastructure consolidation; not adopted

**In plain words.** A real Reddit thread (r/datasets, post `1te2a5z`)
surfaced `github.com/daniel3303/Equibles` — an open-source,
self-hostable data server covering SEC filings, insider trades,
congressional trades, 13F holdings, short interest, FRED, and CFTC/CBOE
data in one tool. Since QAMC already runs several SEPARATE pipelines for
overlapping data (SEC Form 4 insider trades, the two congressional
sources in PR #271, FRED macro data), this was evaluated as a possible
consolidation, not just another congress-data option. Verdict: **real,
well-built, genuinely free — and not worth adopting right now.**

**What's real, verified by reading the actual source and license (not
the README):**
- Substantial, serious project: 3,667 C# files, 93 projects, 2,341
  tests, real CI (a live smoke-test suite that hit the real government
  endpoints and passed the same day this was evaluated).
- All data sources are genuine primaries (SEC EDGAR, House Clerk, Senate
  eFD, FINRA, FRED, CFTC, CBOE) — no third-party reseller in the chain,
  unlike every other option checked this session.
- **It has already solved the exact data-quality defects found in this
  session's own work**, with the actual root causes cited in code
  comments: the same honorific/name-fragmentation bug, the same
  doubled-token merge bug (with a real guard against over-merging
  distinct people who share initials), and the same "P"/"Purchase"
  transaction-type inconsistency — all fixed at the type level, keyed
  on official government BioGuide IDs rather than fuzzy name matching.
  It also covers the Senate, which PR #271 does not.
- **AGPL-3.0 licensing does not block internal use.** The disclosure
  obligation (§13) only triggers on a MODIFIED version exposed to
  external users over a network — running it unmodified, internally,
  triggers nothing, and querying it from QAMC's own Python code over
  MCP/HTTP does not make QAMC's own codebase AGPL (arm's-length
  inter-process communication, not linking). Real, if distant, risk
  noted: the author's contributor agreement lets them relicense future
  versions away from AGPL, a real single-author/commercial-cloud fork
  risk, though not an immediate one.
- **The free self-hosted tier is not artificially crippled** — grepped
  the entire source for premium/license-gating markers and found none;
  the paid "Equibles Cloud" adds genuinely different data (live quotes,
  options Greeks, earnings transcripts), not throttled versions of the
  free features.

**Why it's not being adopted now, real tradeoffs:**
- **No way to run just the congress scraper.** All 35 of its background
  services start unconditionally — adopting it for congressional data
  alone means also running its full SEC EDGAR sync, 13F bulk import,
  and Yahoo price history, whether wanted or not.
- **Real operational cost**: four containers (a search-extended Postgres
  fork, a web service, an MCP service, a worker), a Playwright browser
  runtime, 5-10GB+ of growing storage — versus PR #271's two plain JSON
  fetches with zero infrastructure.
- **The Senate scraper is the highest-risk component in the whole
  project**: its own code comments state it deliberately bypasses a bot
  detection vendor (Akamai) by reusing browser TLS fingerprints — an
  adversarial scraping arrangement against a service that actively
  updates its defenses, and the single most likely thing to silently
  break.
- **This would be importing real, standing machinery to improve a
  signal that this desk has deliberately made confirmatory-only and
  incapable of driving a trade decision on its own** — exactly the
  pattern this project has a standing principle against (see "No
  arbitrary numbers" and the earlier rejection of a CTA-style
  volatility-target sizing overlay for the same underlying reason:
  check a technique's real cost against what it actually buys before
  importing it).

**What to actually do instead, in order:**
1. Reimplement the honorific/doubled-token name-normalization APPROACH
   in QAMC's own Python (from the documented rules, not by copying the
   AGPL source — porting an approach is fine, transcribing the code
   would make that file AGPL) — this is the one clearly valuable,
   cheaply-portable piece.
2. Record the Senate-coverage gap in PR #271 as a known, accepted
   limitation — Equibles proves it's achievable, but only at a real,
   ongoing maintenance cost this desk doesn't need to take on for a
   confirmatory-only signal.
3. Keep Equibles in mind ONLY if a genuinely new, currently-unserved
   need shows up — specifically FINRA short interest/days-to-cover or
   CFTC positioning data, which QAMC has no source for at all today.
   If that need becomes real and measured, trial Equibles on a scratch
   box with a narrowed ticker list for a bounded period before deciding
   — do not adopt on the strength of this evaluation alone.
4. Do not touch the existing SEC Form 4 or FRED pipelines — both
   already work, both are small, and replacing working code with a
   four-container dependency for the same data would be a straight
   downgrade in operational risk for no gain.

## 2026-09-10 — stop-floor base re-derived again: 1.5 -> 2.5 ATR, doctrine not our own data

The 1.5x ATR floor (item 33, above) was measured via Sweeney MAE analysis on
this desk's own ~2-week trade signal history. That same window was later
found (2026-09-04/05) to include seat outputs that misreported confidence
and data quality — the "content-honesty" fixes. Owner call: a risk-of-ruin
number should not rest solely on data of now-uncertain provenance, even
though it is not necessarily wrong.

Replaced with 2.5x ATR, sourced from published swing-trading doctrine
instead: general stop-placement guidance puts a fixed entry stop at
2.5-3.0x ATR for a multi-day hold (vs 1.0x scalping, 1.5-2.0x intraday
momentum). Chandelier Exit (Chuck LeBeau) and Van Tharp's volatility-stop
work were also raised in this discussion — both use a similar 2-3x ATR
magnitude, but as TRAILING stops (recalculated off each new high), not
fixed distances from a static entry. They are cited here as corroboration
that this magnitude is standard in the literature, not as direct support
for this specific fixed-entry use — noted so the two are not conflated by a
future reader.

**Owner clarification carried into docs/WORK.md item 1, permanent:** the
reward:risk floor was never rejected as a concept. What was rejected
(2026-09-02/03, see item 1's original history above) was judging a trade's
reward:risk against a stop THE ATR FLOOR invented, instead of a real
support/resistance level. That distinction is unaffected by this change — a
level-backed stop (e.g. the live ORCL position, entry 146.82 / stop 137.53
at a computed support level) is honoured at its own honest distance
regardless of what this floor is set to. This number only ever applies to a
stop with nothing real on the chart behind it.

**Known, disclosed tension, not resolved by this change:**
`min_reward_risk_after_widening` (1.5) requires roughly
`sqrt(hold_sessions) >= 1.5 x effective_multiple` to clear. At the tightest
reachable case (range setup, risk-on: 2.5 x 0.90 = 2.25 ATR) that needs
~10 sessions — in line with this desk's real observed holds (e.g. ORCL's
own 10-session horizon). At the widest (breakout, risk-off: 2.5 x 1.00 x
1.20 = 3.0 ATR) it needs ~20 sessions — a real ask, not a free pass. This
is the same shape of tension the old 3.0 constant created (which
effectively passed nothing); 2.5 does not eliminate it, it moves the
binding constraint into a range this desk's own stated horizons can
plausibly satisfy. **Re-measure once honest post-fix trade history
exists** — this is a doctrine-grounded placeholder, not a permanent
constant.

Test fixtures in `tests/test_risk_based_sizing.py` and
`tests/test_shorts_stage3.py` that hand-derive specific stop/reward:risk
values to prove the level-backed-vs-unbacked distinction were re-derived
by hand against the new base (not relabelled from actual output) —
worked arithmetic is in each fixture's own comment.

## 2026-09-10 — a persistently broken ticker in the intraday scan could fail silently forever

**In plain words:** the every-30-minute scan that watches for stocks making a
big move could not tell "this stock is broken and Alpaca won't give us data
on it" apart from "this stock just didn't move today." Both looked
identical: the stock was quietly skipped. A ticker that started failing —
delisted, renamed, a data-provider glitch — could stay silently excluded
from every single scan, forever, with nothing ever telling the owner.

**Where this came from.** Found while confirming the BRK-B ticker-spelling
fix (`docs/INCIDENT_HISTORY.md`, "QAMC Pipeline Autopsy") was general and
not a one-off patch. It is general — any class-share ticker is translated
the same way, and a second, independent fix already stops one bad symbol
from crashing the whole 101-symbol batch. But neither of those fixes gives
the owner any way to find out a specific symbol has gone dark. The owner
asked directly: "will I find out, or will it fail silently the next day,
and the next, and the next hour, and the next" — the honest answer, checked
against the actual code, was no.

**The fix.** A new table, `intraday_symbol_health`, tracks each symbol's
CONSECUTIVE miss count (reset to 0 on any tick that returns real snapshot
data). At 3 consecutive misses (~90 minutes at this scan's 30-minute
cadence) it fires a standalone Telegram alert naming the symbol and how
long it has been failing, then waits at least 24 hours before repeating the
same alert while the symbol stays broken — a known, already-flagged
problem does not need to re-page every 30 minutes, but it also must never
go more than a day without a reminder.

**Why 3, not 1 or 5.** A single miss is routinely a transient API blip that
resolves on its own the next tick — alerting on one would be noise. Three
in a row mirrors this codebase's own existing standard for "rule out one
noisy reading before acting" (the holding-discipline structural-protection
break requires 2 consecutive daily closes before it counts as real, not
noise — see item 25 above). Three during a scan that ticks every 30 minutes
catches a real, ongoing problem well within the same trading session,
which is the actual goal — the original BRK-B bug went undetected for
roughly a week of silent failures; this closes that same shape of gap for
any future bad ticker, not just that one.

**Why the 24-hour cooldown, unlike the data-quality alert's deliberate
no-deduplication.** `maybe_alert_data_quality` fires once per SESSION
(5-6 times a day) and is deliberately never deduplicated, because a
repeated alert on an unresolved session-level problem is meant to be
noticed each time. This scan ticks every 30 minutes; undeduplicated would
mean a dozen-plus identical pages before the trading day is even half over
for a problem the owner has already been told about once. The goal here is
"cannot go unnoticed for days," not "must repeat every tick" — a daily
reminder satisfies the first without becoming the second.

**What would catch a regression:** `tests/test_db.py` pins the threshold,
the per-symbol independence of the streak, the reset-on-recovery behaviour,
and both the cooldown-suppression and cooldown-elapsed-so-realert cases at
the database layer. `tests/test_intraday_scan.py` proves the wiring
end-to-end with a real (non-mocked) database: one miss does not page,
three consecutive misses for the same symbol pages exactly once, and a
recovered symbol's streak resets rather than carrying into a later,
unrelated outage.

## 2026-09-10 — the order-fill timeout was the wrong question; watch for the fill instead

**In plain words:** when the desk buys a stock, it places an order and then
gives up on it if the order doesn't fill within a fixed number of seconds —
because a filled position needs its protective stop-loss immediately, and
an order still hasn't produced a position yet, so waiting too long risks
nothing directly but risks losing the trade to an over-eager cancel. That
number had already been raised twice (15 -> 30 seconds) after real trades
were lost to it. The desk was about to raise it a third time, to a properly
researched 90 seconds — until the owner asked a different question:
why is this a guess-a-number problem at all, when Alpaca can just tell the
code the instant an order fills?

**The owner was right, and it took one search to confirm, not a research
project.** Alpaca's own documentation names its real-time `trade_updates`
websocket stream as the way to know about a fill, specifically instead of
repeatedly asking the REST API "did it fill yet?" The desk's code was
doing exactly the polling pattern Alpaca's docs describe as the thing not
to do — asking once a second, in a loop, for up to a fixed timeout.

**The fix:** `wait_for_order_terminal` (`src/execution/broker.py`) now
subscribes to Alpaca's real-time order stream for the specific order it is
watching. A fill, cancel, or rejection is detected the instant Alpaca
reports it — no more guessing how long is "enough." Three real outcomes,
each handled on purpose:

- **A terminal event arrives for this order** — return it immediately. No
  REST call needed. This is the common case, and it is now effectively
  instantaneous instead of costing up to a full poll interval.
- **The stream connects cleanly but nothing arrives before the timeout**
  (the order is genuinely still open) — one single REST check, to preserve
  this function's existing contract of returning the last known status.
- **The stream itself cannot be used at all** (library unavailable, or the
  websocket never reaches a live, authenticated connection) — fall back to
  the exact REST-polling loop this function used before this change, so a
  websocket outage degrades to the old, already-proven-reliable behaviour
  rather than to no behaviour at all.

**The timeout did not disappear — it was demoted.** 90 seconds (the
originally-researched, never-shipped number) is now the ceiling for the
RARE fallback path only, not the primary detection mechanism. There is
close to no cost to a generous fallback timeout now, because the common
case no longer uses it at all.

**Why this belongs in the project's permanent doctrine, not just this
fix.** Recorded in `docs/OUTCOME.md` under a new principle, "Check what the
platform already solved, before tuning your own workaround" — companion
to the existing "no arbitrary numbers" principle. The lesson generalizes
past this one function: before adding a timeout, retry count, or polling
interval around a THIRD-PARTY API's behavior, check whether that API's own
documentation already describes the real mechanism for the problem. A
broker or data API serious enough to run a trading desk on has almost
always already published the answer.

**What would catch a regression:** `tests/test_order_fill_stream.py`
proves the dispatch logic end to end with a fake stream double — no real
network I/O — covering the fast-fill path, a non-matching update still
correctly falling to a single REST check, and three distinct
stream-unusable scenarios (library missing, subscribe failure, connection
failure) all correctly falling back to the untouched polling
implementation. `tests/test_broker.py`'s existing polling test now passes
`use_stream=False` to exercise that fallback path directly and
deterministically.

## 2026-09-04 — two bugs in the drawdown-brake multipliers themselves: a decorative daily circuit breaker, and a 20-day brake that contradicted the de-levering ladder by twenty points

PR #263 (same day, merged) fixed the *unit* the three drawdown brakes are
expressed in — from flat hard-coded percentages to `N × max_position_risk_pct`
— and deliberately left every multiplier `N` untouched, on the grounds that
the 2026-09-02 clean-slate reset wiped the equity history needed to validate
them. That was right about the anchor. It was wrong that nothing about the
multipliers could be checked: two of the three were wrong for reasons that
need no trade history at all, only internal consistency. Both are fixed here.

The multiplier calibration itself — the anchor `N_5d = 3` — is **not** touched
and stays provisional (docs/WORK.md item 32).

### Bug 1 — the daily circuit breaker shared the 5-day window's multiplier, which made it decorative

**State before.** `risk.daily_loss_risk_multiple: 3` and
`risk.drawdown_5d_risk_multiple: 3` — the same number. At the ratified 5%
per-trade risk unit both resolved to a **-15%** threshold: one at the end of a
single session, one at the end of five.

**Why that is wrong on its face.** Two windows of very different length cannot
share one threshold and fire at anything like a comparable rate. A -15% loss in
one session on a long-only book of this size is not a bad trading day; it is a
single-name gap event. The breaker could therefore only ever fire on a tail it
was never the right instrument for, and never on the ordinary run of bad days it
exists to stop. In practice: decorative.

**The doctrine.** Drawdown magnitude over a window scales with the square root
of the window length — Van Hemert, Ganz, Harvey et al., *"Drawdowns"*, Journal
of Portfolio Management, 2020. For a consistent statistical firing rate across
windows, thresholds must scale as `√T`, not sit flat.

**Derivation.** The 5-day window is the one item 32's research found reasonably
calibrated, so it is the anchor:

```
N_1d = N_5d × √(1/5)
     = 3.0  × 0.4472135955
     = 1.3416407865...
     → 1.34                (2dp — the anchor is provisional to roughly the
                            nearest half, so more digits would be false
                            precision)

threshold = 1.34 × max_position_risk_pct
          = 1.34 × 5%
          = 6.7%
```

**Result.** `daily_loss_risk_multiple: 3 → 1.34`, `max_daily_loss_pct: 15 →
6.7`. The 1-day : 5-day ratio is now **1 : √5 = 1 : 2.24** instead of 1 : 1.
The shipped 1.34 gives 2.2388, 0.12% off exact √5 — the residual of rounding to
2dp, orders of magnitude smaller than the uncertainty in the provisional anchor.

Worked case, now covered by a test: an **-8% day** on a $100k book. Under the
old 15% breaker: no violation. Under 6.7%: violation raised.

### Bug 2 — the 20-day brake stayed silent long past the point the desk's OTHER drawdown system had already alerted the owner

**This desk has two independent drawdown-response systems and they were never
reconciled.**

1. The **§11.2 gross-exposure de-levering ladder**
   (`src/risk/rules.py::GROSS_LADDER`, owner-ratified 2026-09-01), on
   *peak-to-trough* drawdown:

   | drawdown | gross ceiling |
   |---|---|
   | better than -8% | 2.0× |
   | -8% to -15% | 1.5× |
   | -15% to -20% | 1.0× |
   | worse than -20% | 0.5×, **and the owner is alerted** (`GROSS_LADDER_ALERT_PCT`) |

2. The newer **rolling-return drawdown brakes**
   (`RiskConfig.drawdown_5d_threshold_pct` / `drawdown_20d_threshold_pct`,
   halving new BUY size via `apply_drawdown_scale`), which after PR #263 sat at
   **-15%** (5-day) and **-40%** (20-day).

**The contradiction.** At -20% the ladder has cut gross exposure to 0.5× — it
has halved the book — and woken the owner. The 20-day brake, at -40%, was at
that point still completely silent, and stayed silent for another **twenty
points** of drawdown. That is not a difference of conservatism between two
tuned systems; it is two systems that disagree about whether the desk is in
trouble at all. Neither was written with reference to the other.

**Minimal honest fix.** The newer brake must not still be asleep past the point
the older system escalates to the owner:

```
N_20d ≤ |GROSS_LADDER_ALERT_PCT| / max_position_risk_pct
      = 20 / 5
      = 4.0        → threshold -20%, exactly the alert rung
```

`drawdown_20d_risk_multiple: 8 → 4`.

**The 5-day brake was left alone, on purpose.** At -15% it lands exactly on the
ladder's -15% → 1.0× rung. The two systems already agree at that window, so
there was nothing to reconcile and no reason to move a provisional number.

**The ladder itself was not touched.** Its calibration is owner-ratified and was
not the subject of this fix. A cross-referencing comment was added above
`GROSS_LADDER` so the next person to re-tune either side sees the other.

**Note the tension, stated rather than hidden.** -20% is *tighter* than √time
scaling from the 5-day anchor would give (`3 × √(20/5) = 6`, i.e. -30%). The
ladder constraint binds before the sqrt-consistency one. Where published
doctrine and an already-live sibling system disagree, matching the live system
is the honest minimal move — but it does mean the three windows are no longer on
a single consistent √time curve, and that is a real cost.

### What is still open — an owner-level decision, not a mechanical fix

Full reconciliation of the two drawdown systems is **not done and not decided
here.** What shipped is a *floor on the disagreement*, not agreement. The two
measure genuinely different quantities (peak-to-trough equity vs rolling-window
return), were calibrated independently years apart in this repo's history, and
nobody has decided whether this desk should have one drawdown response or two,
which of them governs, or whether the rolling-return brake should be expressed
in peak-to-trough terms so the two are even comparable. Flagged in docs/WORK.md
item 32 with a decide-by date.

### Verification

`tests/test_drawdown_brake_rescale.py` extended with the worked numbers above,
including two regression guards that reproduce each defect (setting the daily
multiple back to 3.0, or the 20-day back to 8.0, and asserting the wrong
behaviour follows) so neither can be silently reintroduced.

Suite before: 4908 passed, 1 failed, 1 skipped. Suite after: unchanged pass
posture with the new tests added. The single failure,
`tests/test_rehearsal_reproduces_cost_ceiling.py::test_rehearsal_reproduces_2026_08_28_pm_cost_ceiling_failure`,
is **pre-existing on main and unrelated** — docs/WORK.md item 28 records it as
fixed, which is stale; it is still red.


### 2026-09-04 — item 32's conviction-band question: a portfolio volatility target was investigated and rejected; the band-restoration proposal itself is still open

**Process note, added on restoring this entry:** the PR this came from
(#259) was never actually judged by the owner — he was asleep when it
got mechanically auto-closed as a side effect of an unrelated branch
deletion (see `docs/WORK.md` item 32). The vol-target rejection below
is grounded in real, already-established doctrine from earlier the same
night (see `docs/OUTCOME.md`), so that part stands.

**Band restoration — DECIDED 2026-09-11, owner call.** Restore the
pre-compression bands. Owner's own framing: conviction sizing exists for
a reason, this desk has no outside investors to smooth returns for, and
the fix should be checked against every other cap before shipping —
verified below, not just asserted.

**In plain words.** PR #258 fixed the 20% notional cap but left one
question open (item 32): now that trades can actually deliver the risk
the PM asks for, should the conviction-to-risk bands widen back to their
original numbers, or should sizing move to something more sophisticated —
an explicit volatility-parity overlay, or a full CTA-style
portfolio-level volatility TARGET (one dial, ~10-20% annualized, that
scales every position to hit it)? Tonight's task was to build the
volatility-target version. Before writing it, the design was checked
against what this codebase already does and against the owner's actual
mandate, and both checks said stop.

**What was checked.** The per-trade sizing path
(`PortfolioConstructor._plan_risk_targets`, `src/portfolio_constructor.py`)
was read in full end to end: a target's requested risk comes from the
PM's own conviction judgement (a real per-idea range the model chooses
within, not a single number applied to everything), is then reduced —
never raised — by the §9.4 agreement ceiling (signed source score) and by
`allocate_risk_budget`'s total/cluster ceilings, and is converted to a
position size by `risk_pct x entry / |entry - stop|`, where the stop is
already ATR/volatility-derived (`risk.min_stop_atr_multiple`). There is
no second, hidden flat number anywhere in that path — the only hard caps
are the disclosed backstops (5% single-name, 25% total, 40% per cluster),
each independent and each already ratified.

**Why a portfolio volatility target was rejected, not built.** Two
distinct objections surfaced, either one sufficient on its own:

1. **It would mostly duplicate machinery that already exists.** The
   book-level "don't let too much ride on one bet" job already has an
   owner: `max_portfolio_risk_pct` (25%, the sum of every position's
   loss-if-stopped) plus `max_cluster_risk_share_pct` (40%, correlated
   names sharing one bet's budget via `src/data/correlation.py`'s
   measured 5-year return correlation, connected components at
   `|corr| >= 0.7`). A real, rigorous portfolio-volatility number (one
   that actually accounts for how positions move together, i.e.
   `w'*Σ*w` over a real covariance matrix) would be MORE rigorous than
   the threshold-clustering approximation currently in place — that part
   of the owner's own question was fair — but building it honestly would
   need a full covariance-weighted sizing engine, not a config dial, and
   this book has no realized-return history yet to calibrate or validate
   one against (reset 2026-09-02). A single scalar "target %" bolted on
   without that machinery would just be a second, cruder version of the
   cluster cap wearing a more sophisticated-sounding name — exactly the
   "two dials doing almost the same job" the owner does not want.
2. **The practice itself belongs to a different mandate.** CTA/trend-
   following funds target annualized portfolio volatility because they
   are selling outside LPs a smooth, comparable return stream — the
   target exists to serve THAT goal. This desk trades one owner's own
   capital and is judged on survival, not smoothness
   (`docs/OUTCOME.md`, "a trading desk, not a retirement portfolio" —
   the same principle that already rejected retirement-style sector
   diversification for its own sake). Importing the target quietly
   imports the goal it was built for, which this desk never had.

**What actually shipped.** Item 32's fork is resolved as (a), not (b):
the conviction bands (`config/prompts/portfolio_manager.md`, Step 5) are
restored to their original, pre-2026-08-27-compression values —
2.0-4.0% / 1.0-2.5% / 0.5-1.0% for high/moderate/low conviction, and the
sizing-formula worked example's base mids updated to match (3.0 / 1.75 /
0.75) — now that the notional ceiling that forced them down to
1.5-3.0% / 1.0-2.0% (PR #258) is fixed at 100%. The 5% hard cap, the 25%
total ceiling and the 40% cluster share are all UNCHANGED; nothing about
them conflicts with or is made redundant by this — they were never the
same category of defect as the flat per-trade guess, because they act as
backstops on top of idea-specific sizing rather than substituting for it.

**DECIDED 2026-09-11, owner call, cap interactions re-verified before
shipping (not just re-asserted).** The 4.0% ceiling (new high-conviction
top) stays under the 5% hard risk cap regardless. Checked directly
against the LIVE config, not the numbers this analysis was originally
written against: `min_stop_atr_multiple` moved 3.0 -> 2.5 on 2026-09-10
(item 42, published-doctrine stop floor), so the "quiet-name stops run
5-9% of price" figure the 100% notional ceiling was sized against is
now stale — recomputed at the new floor, typical stops now run roughly
5.5-7.7% of price (2.14-3.0x ATR at this desk's ~2.56% median ATR). At a
4% risk request and a 5.5% stop, that is `4 / 5.5 x 100 ≈ 73%` notional
— comfortably inside the 100% ceiling with real headroom, not a close
call. Only a stop tighter than 4% of price (reachable via the
level-backed exemption down to 1x ATR, ~2.56%) would still hit the
notional clamp — the same, already-intentional "genuinely too tight"
case the ceiling exists for, not a new edge case this restoration
creates. `max_position_pct`'s own comment in `config/settings.yaml`
still cites the pre-2.5 stop figures and should be refreshed to match,
tracked as a small follow-up doc fix, not a blocker.

No code in `src/` changed for this entry — the fix is confined to the
prompt's stated bands and this documentation. No new tests were added:
the sizing arithmetic itself (`risk_pct x entry / |entry - stop|`,
`allocate_risk_budget`, the cluster cap) is unchanged and already covered
by `tests/test_risk_based_sizing.py`, `tests/test_portfolio_constructor.py`
and `tests/test_risk_budget.py`.

## 2026-09-11 — smart-money evidence was judged as an island on a calendar; it now has to correlate with something real

**In plain words:** the desk watches insider and congressional stock trades
as one piece of evidence toward a trade decision. Until now, if too many
days passed since that trade was filed, the system stopped trusting it
completely — it didn't just weigh it less, it actively relabeled the whole
finding "historical" so it could never support a target again, no matter
what else was happening with the stock. The owner pushed back hard on this,
in his own words: insider information isn't always about tomorrow — someone
can position months ahead of a known future event — and other evidence
(a slow price drift, unusual accumulation, moving-average confirmation) can
independently show whether the original information is still playing out.
Treating the trade as an island judged only on its own age threw all of
that away.

**The owner's proposed fix, verbatim in spirit:** "this is one piece of
information — if it doesn't correlate with anything else, that's fine, it
just changes the decision matrix; if it does correlate, stronger weights."
No decay curve, no better day-count — drop the calendar test entirely and
let correlation with other CURRENT evidence decide whether it counts.

**Why dropping the age gate outright is the right call, not just simpler.**
Checked against real published research before building this, not just
taking the intuition on faith:
- Seyhun (1986), the foundational academic study on insider trading:
  only about a quarter of the eventual abnormal return from an insider
  purchase shows up in the first 5 days: **half of it is still unrealized
  a full month later.** A 7-day cutoff was throwing away most of the real
  signal before it had even played out.
- Real M&A research shows target-company price run-ups beginning **months**
  before the deal is ever announced, frequently alongside unusual trading
  volume — exactly the kind of independent, current confirmation the owner
  described technical analysis being able to catch.

**What actually shipped.** `SmartMoneyFinding.support_eligible`
(`src/models.py`) is now purely STRUCTURAL: is this real, single-direction,
legally-disclosed evidence at all. It no longer references age or
freshness in any way. Whether an eligible finding can actually be cited as
`supports` on a target is decided separately, in
`PortfolioManagerAgent`'s grounding validator, by a new correlation check:
at least one OTHER current source (technical, news, earnings, macro)
already covering that symbol must independently point the same direction.
An insider trade with nothing else backing it right now is still shown to
the PM as context — it simply doesn't get to count as support on its own,
regardless of whether it happened yesterday or three months ago. This
mirrors, deliberately, how the desk already treats aged EARNINGS evidence
(`EARNINGS_STANCE_MAX_AGE_DAYS`, `src/risk/rules.py`) — a stale stance
there was never deleted or relabeled either, it simply stopped counting
toward the vote while remaining visible. Smart-money simply wasn't built
the same way until now.

**One distinction deliberately preserved, not touched by this change.**
The STOCK Act's 45-day legal filing deadline for congressional disclosures
(`lag_days <= 45`) is a check about whether a disclosure was filed on time,
not about how old the underlying trade's information is — a member who
discloses 90 days late broke the law regardless of how interesting the
trade itself is. That check is untouched.

**The fetch/retention window was also widened, separately, 7 -> 90 days**
(`SmartMoneyConfig.lookback_days`) — a trade older than the old 7-day
window was never even loaded for the analyst to see at all, regardless of
this eligibility fix. 90 reuses the desk's own existing earnings-evidence
precedent (`EARNINGS_STANCE_MAX_AGE_DAYS`) rather than inventing a new
number. This is a practical fetch bound only, not a re-introduced
staleness gate — real evidence older than 90 days still isn't loaded, a
known, disclosed limit of this fix rather than a claim of solving the
general case.

**What would catch a regression:** `tests/test_smart_money.py` proves a
60-day-old, single-actor, single-direction insider buy is still
structurally eligible (age alone no longer disqualifies), and a genuinely
contradictory (mixed buy/sell direction) finding is still correctly
downgraded. `tests/test_congressional_trading.py` proves the same for
congressional evidence, and separately proves the 45-day legal-disclosure
check still binds regardless of this change. `tests/test_pm_grounding.py`
proves the actual behavior change end to end: identical, equally-aged
insider evidence is rejected as support when nothing else currently
agrees with it, and accepted when a current technical read does — the
correlation, not the calendar, is what decided the outcome in both cases.

## Moved out of docs/WORK.md, 2026-09-11 — closed records freeing space under the byte cap

**Why this section exists:** `docs/WORK.md` was 99,447 bytes against its
100,000-byte hard cap, with almost no headroom left for new work. Everything
below was genuinely finished — landed, shipped, or a checked non-defect —
with no open question or follow-up left attached. Moved here verbatim rather
than deleted, the same way the 2026-08-31 and 2026-09-02 records were.

### 2026-08-27 — the model benchmark harness was broken two independent ways, and nothing caught it

**In plain words:** the tool used to compare AI models against each other
silently stopped working, twice over, and nobody noticed until it was
needed.

1. **The model benchmark harness was broken two independent ways and nothing
   detected either.** `ops/model_policy/scenarios.py` stopped importing when
   Phase 1 (`138edd2`) made `setup_type` required — same day — AND it had
   carried a backslash inside an f-string expression since `2016c9b`
   (2026-08-14), which is a SyntaxError on Python 3.11, the project's declared
   floor and what CI runs. Local dev is 3.12, so it parsed here and never
   there. `tests/test_ops_scripts_importable.py` now imports every module
   under `ops/` and `scripts/` and rejects 3.12-only f-strings, because
   `pytest` collects `tests/` only and that blind spot is what let both sit.

### 2026-08-27 — Phase 3 was reordered ahead of Phase 2, and the position-reviewer model question was resolved

**In plain words:** two decisions from the same review session. Exits were
being cut too early against a self-referential pace metric, so the fix for
that jumped the queue; and a plan to swap the exit-reviewer to a stronger,
much more expensive model turned out to rest on a false premise once the
actual measured scores were read.

- **Phase 3 runs before the rest of Phase 2.** The spec's stated order is
  Phase 2 → Phase 3. The owner reordered it on the evidence below. Phase 1
  already shipped `expected_horizon_sessions`, which is what Phase 3's pace fix
  needs, so nothing blocks it.
  *Evidence:* on 2026-08-26/27 the book went to fully flat. The evening
  reviewer graded its own exits — EPD (5d) **premature**, "thesis may have only
  been temporarily paused"; MRVL (5d) **premature**, "thesis intact... closed
  position anyway". Two of the last three exits cut intact theses. Sizing
  trades more precisely does not help when they are cut on day 5 against a
  self-referential pace metric.
- **§3.5 resolved: leave the reviewer's model alone, fix the scenario instead.**
  The spec's premise — `position_reviewer` runs "the weakest model in the
  stack" — is contradicted by `ops/model_policy/results/merged.json`:
  `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite` scores `quality_min 1.0 / quality_mean 1.0`
  at `midday_exit`, tied with `openai/gpt-5.5`,
  `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro-0813`, `qwen/qwen3.7-flash` and
  `qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507`, and scores 1.0 on every scenario it was ever
  measured on. `gpt-5.5` costs ~84x more per review ($0.0927 vs $0.0011) for
  no measured gain. The real EPD/MRVL failure was a broken pace metric and
  missing memory, not model weakness. The honest gap is that `midday_exit`
  ties five of twelve candidates at 1.0 and therefore does not discriminate;
  the owner chose to build a scenario that does (the EPD shape: metrics
  improved, reason claims stalling) rather than pay 84x on faith. Routing
  unchanged.

### 2026-08-28 — config drift between git and the production box, closed

**In plain words:** the live trading box had five settings that had been
hand-edited directly on the server and never saved into git. Any deploy that
skipped a manual save/restore step would have silently wiped them out —
including the two changes made specifically to end that day's outage.

**Config drift is closed (2026-08-28).** `config/settings.yaml` in git now
matches the production box byte for byte. Until this change the box carried
five hand-edited values that existed nowhere in git, so any deploy that lost
the stash/pop step would have silently reverted them — including the two that
were raised specifically to end the 2026-08-28 outage. Reconciled:

| setting | was in git | now (and live) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `intraday_scan.enabled` | `false` | `true` |
| `llm_cost_circuit.daily_cost_limit_usd` | `1.50` | `2.75` |
| `llm_cost_circuit.session_reserved_exposure_limit_usd` | `1.80` | `2.60` |
| `llm_cost_circuit.daily_reserved_exposure_limit_usd` | `1.90` | `5.50` |
| `llm_cost_circuit.max_paid_sessions_per_mode_per_day` | `2` | `8` |

Two corrections to the 2026-08-28 notes recorded elsewhere in this file: the
git baseline for `daily_reserved_exposure_limit_usd` was `1.90`, not `3.20`
(`3.20` was itself an earlier uncommitted box value), and `daily_cost_limit_usd`
was also a git delta — the box had been running `2.75` against a committed
`1.50`.

### 2026-08-28 — a stale branch-preview server was masking a week of cockpit work as Mission Control

**In plain words:** for a week, checking the dashboard at a bookmarked
address showed old code, making finished work look like it hadn't shipped.
The address was never Mission Control at all — it was a throwaway preview
server someone forgot to kill.

**The Mission Control URL — and a stale preview that was masking a week of
work (2026-08-28).**

- The correct, production Mission Control address is
  `https://ovh-vps.wallaby-bowfin.ts.net/cockpit/`. Tailscale Serve proxies
  tailnet-only port 443 to the qamc API on `127.0.0.1:8800`.
- The qamc API binds loopback-only by design (`QUANT_AGENT_API_HOST=127.0.0.1`
  in `quant-agent-api.service`). Tailscale Serve, not the bind address, is what
  makes it reachable. Do not "fix" reachability by rebinding the service.
- `http://100.111.170.97:8810/cockpit` is NOT Mission Control. It was
  `ops/preview/branch_preview.py`, the ephemeral branch-preview server,
  running as the parked `dev` account out of
  `/home/dev/projects/quant-agent-dashboard`. Its own module docstring states
  it has no systemd unit and no auto-start and is meant to be killed after a
  review session.
- It was started 2026-08-21 16:16 ET and was still running on 2026-08-28,
  seven days later. It served a bundle built 2026-08-21 09:43 containing no
  dockview layout key at all — predating PR #120 entirely. None of the cockpit
  trader-view work (PR #120, pass 2 via PR #130, pass 3 via PR #137) was
  visible at that address.
- The orphaned process (PID 2267757) was killed on 2026-08-28. Port 8810 is
  now closed. The production URL was re-checked immediately afterward and
  returned HTTP 200.
- **Diagnostic worth keeping:** to tell the two apart in one step, compare the
  hashed bundle filename returned by `curl -sk
  https://ovh-vps.wallaby-bowfin.ts.net/cockpit/` against whatever else claims
  to be the cockpit. Different filenames mean something other than production
  is being served.
- **Consequence for `feat/telegram-links` (PR #136):** it defaults
  `notifications.mission_control_url` to the stale
  `http://100.111.170.97:8810/cockpit` in both `config/settings.yaml` and
  `src/config.py`. That is being corrected to the HTTPS tailnet host before
  merge; note it here so the reason is on record.
- State plainly that this is the likely explanation for the operator
  repeatedly seeing old cockpit code after deploys that had in fact landed
  correctly.

### 2026-08-28 — earnings cache asserts price-derived valuation from filing-only input

**In plain words:** a cached earnings writeup twice mentioned P/E and market
cap even though the analyst was only ever given the filing text, not a
price. Logged and accepted rather than fixed — it is a cosmetic mismatch,
not a wrong conclusion.

#### EARNINGS CACHE ASSERTS PRICE-DERIVED VALUATION
Repeated on 2026-08-28 for MTZ and KO: the cached earnings analysis asserts price-derived valuation (P/E, market cap) in `valuation_context`, but the agent was given filing text only. Pre-existing; logged as a warning and otherwise ignored.

### 2026-08-28/29 — the rehearsal rig's own non-defects, confirmed rather than assumed

**In plain words:** two behaviors that looked like they might be bugs during
rehearsal-rig testing were checked directly and turned out to be the system
working exactly as intended.

**Confirmed working as designed, not defects:** running with no `--source-data` at all correctly fails closed at the pricing gate ("the cost circuit cannot confirm current rates offline and will suspend paid analysis") before any model call, rather than proceeding with an unbounded cost; and deleting every row from a sandbox copy's `positions` table (simulating a flattened book) correctly surfaced the trade-ledger-vs-broker stop-out reconciler declining to guess ("recording nothing rather than guessing") for all six affected symbols, with the session still completing end-to-end rather than crashing on the inconsistency.

### 2026-08-29 — short selling ships finished and enabled, not behind a flag

**In plain words:** an early draft proposed shipping the new short-selling
feature switched off by default, "to be safe." The owner overruled that: on
a paper account with no real money, a disabled feature is just unvalidated
code hiding from its own bugs.

- **Short selling ships finished and enabled, not behind a flag.** An earlier
  draft proposed shipping Phase 5 stages 2-3 disabled by default. The owner
  rejected that: this is a paper account that resets, markets are closed,
  there are no users and no real money, and a disabled feature is unvalidated
  code — the point of reaching the finish line is to surface the next layer
  of bugs. The gate is completeness and verification, not a switch.

### 2026-08-29/09-02 — a bad analyst seat now gets its own Telegram alert

**In plain words:** before this, a broken data feed for one analyst only
showed up as one easy-to-miss line inside a routine summary message. Now it
pages the owner directly, on its own, every time.

**Also shipped: a bad analyst seat now gets its OWN Telegram alert.**
Before this, `data_status` anything but "ok"/"empty" only showed up as one
line inside the routine session-result message — exactly what the alert
rule below forbids. See PR merging `feat/data-quality-alert`.

### 2026-08-30 — inverse ETFs stay tradeable; paid news sources refused permanently

**In plain words:** two quick owner rulings that closed open questions from
an earlier session: keep the inverse ETFs on the tradeable list, and never
pay for a news source.

Two owner decisions ratified 2026-08-30, recorded as ratified, not inferred:

- **The inverse exchange-traded funds stay in the tradeable list**, not
  retired. Rex: *"they have their uses they can still be useful for some
  situations."*
- **Paid news sources are refused, permanently.** Rex: *"not worth paying for.
  There has to be other sources available."* Free sources only — closes the
  open question the previous session left.

### 2026-09-01 — a held short's sector exposure is tracked per side, not netted against a long

**In plain words:** a short position was making its own sector look
artificially small to the risk system, because a short and a long in the
same sector were being netted against each other as if they cancelled out.
The owner clarified the desk trades opportunities, not hedges, so long and
short exposure in a sector are now each checked against the same limit,
independently.

**~~A held SHORT makes its sector look SMALLER to the risk engine~~ — DECIDED
AND BUILT 2026-09-01.** The owner answered the question this item was raised
to ask: the sector cap measures **concentration, per side**, not net
directional exposure. Long sector exposure and short sector exposure are now
tracked independently, each against the same limit, and neither offsets the
other — *"A long and a short in the same sector is not a hedge... We are
trading opportunities."*

Gross summing was considered and REJECTED, because it would block a legitimate
pair trade (long the leader, short the laggard in one hot sector). Ratified as
spec §12.2 and implemented the same day; the build record, the four
implementations it reconciled, and the yfinance sector-coverage exposure it
did NOT fix are all in `docs/QAMC_REMEDIATION_SPEC.md` §12.2. (The 90%
absolute sector ceiling shipped alongside it, spec §12.3, was left open for
the owner to ratify and stays tracked in `docs/WORK.md`.)

### 2026-09-01 — fractional shares reversed back in, now that the stop is not an OTO bracket leg

**In plain words:** fractional-share buying had been turned off earlier
because of a specific technical reason. That reason stopped being true back
in July, so the feature was turned back on.

- **Fractional shares are IN — this decision was REVERSED on 2026-09-01**
  (spec §11.1) and BUILT the same day. The original reasoning rested on the
  stop being an OTO bracket leg; it has not been one since 2026-07-16, so the
  fill→stop window fractional was said to introduce already existed on every
  entry. Owner: *"if the gap is brief upon entry, then it's irrelevant to
  eliminate that option."* Behind `execution.fractional_enabled` (default on),
  gated on a broker-confirmed `fractionable` flag that fails closed, with the
  three required stop-placement guards. Recovers the whole-share rounding tax
  (V wanted 6%, got 3.84%).

### 2026-09-02 — funnel-queue tail causes, working as intended

**In plain words:** a handful of trade ideas that never became trades, each
for an ordinary, correct reason — not enough cash, a dirty quote, an
outright broker rejection. Not worth chasing further.

**9. Tail causes — 3 of 68 combined. WORKING AS INTENDED.**

Insufficient cash (1), a quote 14.6% off reference rejected as dirty data (1),
outright broker rejection (1). Not material; do not spend time here.

### 2026-09-03 — the afternoon spending reserve is moot, deleted along with the budget guard it belonged to

**In plain words:** an old, half-wired safety feature became irrelevant when
the budget system it was part of got rebuilt from scratch. There is nothing
left to finish.

**16. The afternoon spending reserve — MOOT, deleted with item 14.**

Was 37 unwired lines on `fix/dollar-based-session-cap` (2026-08-29). Item
14's rewrite deleted the entire projection-based reservation layer this
belonged to, so there is nothing left to wire in. Nothing to do.

### 2026-09-04 — a cosmetic double-log line after a rejected BUY

**In plain words:** a rejected trade sometimes logs a second, confusing
line underneath the real reason. Harmless, low priority, recorded so it
isn't rediscovered as new.

- After the constructor rejects a BUY for reward:risk, it logs a second confusing line — "no valid stop below entry (stop=None)" — because the None propagates. Cosmetic.

### 2026-09-12 — the unfilled-entry alert told the owner the opposite of what the code did

**In plain words:** when a buy order failed to fill, the desk sent a message
saying the order had been left working until the market closed. It had not.
The desk had already cancelled it about ninety seconds later, silently. The
README and `config/settings.yaml` repeated the same false claim.

**How it happened.** PR #311 added an "exhaustion" alert on the re-peg path
and described the resting behaviour it *expected*. It never checked
`place_entry_protection`, which had cancelled a still-working entry after
`_ENTRY_FILL_TIMEOUT_S` (90 s) since well before that PR. Nothing tested the
alert's wording against the actual code path, so the two drifted apart with
no failure to notice.

**Fixed in PR #315** ("Stalled entry: one reprice, only once the exchange has
it, then cancelled with its session"). The alert now describes what happens:
the entry is cancelled at the end of its session, the message names the
symbol, the prices tried, the ceiling, and states plainly that nothing was
resubmitted. It fires whether or not repricing is enabled, with the text
saying which was attempted.

**The Alpaca order-execution research behind the rebuild**, preserved here so
it is not re-derived:

- Community practice for a fast market is ONE decisive reprice priced through
  the market — not a ladder of small nudges. Each additional replace is
  another `pending_replace` window; one reported case left a position
  unmanageable.
- An order **cannot** be replaced until it has reached the exchange. Verified
  against alpaca-py 0.44.0's `OrderStatus` enum and Alpaca's published order
  lifecycle: `accepted` = at Alpaca, not yet routed; `pending_new` = routed,
  not yet accepted by the venue; `new` = at the venue. At the open —
  precisely when a chase is most wanted — acknowledgement is slowest, so an
  early replace is the most likely to be rejected. This was a real defect in
  the first build.
- **No community convention exists for a maximum resting time.** The only
  hard sourced argument is Alpaca's own: a resting DAY order consumes buying
  power for as long as it rests. The cancel boundary was therefore derived
  from the desk's own structure — the session process itself — rather than
  invented as a timeout literal.
- **No evidence anywhere of time-of-day-varying chase parameters.** Not
  invented here.
- Correction to a belief held while scoping this: the desk does **not**
  re-scan every 30 minutes. The systemd/launchd tick is every 30 minutes, but
  it only asks whether an ET session is due. Only `intra_check` runs each
  tick, and it places no entries. New entries come only from the morning
  session (09:30–12:00 ET); midday and close sessions review positions.

**`execution.repeg_enabled` stays `false`** — owner decision 2026-09-12,
*"we're not going with repeg"* — and independently has little to act on,
since PR #111 already submits entries at the slippage ceiling whenever a
quote exists.

### 2026-09-12 — a broken data feed was being recorded as a trade the desk turned down

**In plain words:** when the desk could not get the basic facts about a
share — its price, how much it normally moves, or a usable price history —
it wrote the outcome down as "we looked at this trade and rejected it". It
had not looked at anything; it had nothing to look at. So a dead data feed
and a trade that genuinely failed the desk's rules produced the same entry
in the record, nobody could tell them apart, and nobody could say how often
either was happening. The owner spotted this. Nothing about *whether* the
desk trades changed: a share it cannot measure is still not traded.

**What was actually wrong.** The function that works out a trade's target
declines for six named reasons, all carried on one field and all logged by
the constructor as "rejected — no target could be computed". Going through
them one by one:

- *no price at all* — a listed share always has a price. Missing means the
  desk got neither a live quote nor the analyst's entry. Data fault.
- *no volatility reading* — the desk computes this itself from its own
  bars; the model never supplies it. Missing means too few bars or the
  calculation never ran. Data fault.
- *no structural levels* — this one was TWO different things wearing one
  label. The level scan returns the same empty answer when the history was
  too short or too dirty for it to run at all (data fault) and when it ran
  over a full, clean history and found no repeated turning point within
  reach of the price (a real fact about the chart — a relentless trend, or
  every old level too far away). The target function only ever saw the
  empty list, never the history behind it, so it could not tell which.
- *no analysis at all* — found on the same path: the Portfolio Manager
  asked for a share the technical analyst never analysed. Every input is
  missing at once. Data fault.
- *no expected horizon* — the analyst's own estimate of how long the idea
  needs, and the analyst left it out. Not a market-data failure and not a
  rules failure either: an incomplete proposal. Left as a refusal; flagged
  for the owner in case he wants it tracked separately.
- *projection implausible* — real inputs, and the arithmetic says the
  measured move cannot clear its own noise (or a short's target runs
  through zero). A genuine judgement about the trade. Refusal, unchanged.

**What changed.** The two classes now travel on two separate fields and
can never be confused: a *refusal* is a judgement about the trade; a
*fault* means the share could not be measured. The technical analyst now
records, beside the levels it computed, what the bar history actually was
(nothing arrived / too few clean bars for the scan to run / enough clean
bars for the scan to run), read from the bars themselves and from the
scan's own minimum window — no chosen threshold. Only "enough clean bars,
nothing found" stays a refusal.

**Reconciled on merge (2026-09-13) with the same-day stop-width work
(item 54, PR #331).** Three different "minimum bars" had appeared: this
work's coverage check used the pivot scan's 11 bars, the level scan itself
had since come to need 14 (it now reads an ATR for its relevance window),
and item 54 refuses a listing with fewer than 200 completed sessions (the
analyst's own longest indicator window). They are now two, and they answer
two different questions. The scan's precondition is ONE constant read from
its own two parts (a pivot needs 11 bars, an ATR needs 14, so 14), used by
both the scan and the coverage check so they cannot disagree. The 200 is
not a data question at all: a listing too young to measure is a trade
REFUSAL by name, made by the constructor BEFORE this classification runs,
exactly as item 54 built it. This work's separate "too few bars" fault
state was therefore dropped as a duplicate — every history shorter than
the scan minimum is shorter than 200, so item 54's refusal always names
it first — and the remaining "bars arrived but cannot run the scan" state
is the fail-closed backstop for a row whose session count was never
recorded. A dead feed (no bars at all) is still a fault, which item 54
deliberately does not judge.

A fault is written to the record under its own name (`data_fault`, with the
specific fault code) instead of `constructor_dropped`, so the desk's own
"why didn't we trade" census counts it separately. The eligibility check
that runs over every analysed share before the Portfolio Manager decides
records faults the same way, so a share that silently became unanalysable
before anyone proposed it still leaves a row. And every session with at
least one unmeasurable share sends the owner one standalone message naming
each share and its fault — the same out-of-band alert path the desk already
uses when an entry order is cancelled — because a share quietly dropping out
of the analysable set is exactly the failure that hides.

**Was the statistic already wrong?** Checked against the live database and
the systemd journal before assuming so. The constructor's drop reasons have
only been persisted since 2026-09-03, and the live database holds no
constructor-drop rows at all since then (the desk has been paused). The
journal back to 2026-08-09 shows the "no target could be computed" line
fired three times, all for the now-unreachable "no level in the direction"
reason — never for the two data-fault reasons. So the census was not yet
carrying a wrong number; the code path that would have produced one is what
was fixed. No historical rows needed re-labelling.

**What would catch it next time.** Tests now fail if a data fault comes
back on the refusal field, if a fault and a refusal are ever set together,
if a faulted share is filed as `constructor_dropped`, or if one occurs
without the owner alert. A measured-but-empty chart is pinned as a refusal,
so a quiet chart cannot page the owner as an outage.

### 2026-09-12 — every PAST earnings marker was invisible, for every symbol

**In plain words:** the cockpit price chart is supposed to show a purple "E"
marker for each earnings report, past and upcoming. Only upcoming ones ever
showed up. Oracle reported on 2026-09-10 and the chart showed nothing for it
— the only marker ORCL had was a future date in December.

**How it happened.** The past-earnings source (`yfinance`'s
`Ticker.earnings_dates`) needs the optional `lxml` package to parse the page
it reads. Production never had `lxml` installed. The call failed with
`ImportError` every time, and the code caught that exception and logged it
at DEBUG level, returning an empty result — the exact same empty result a
symbol with genuinely no earnings history would produce. A separate,
lxml-free source (`Ticker.calendar`) still supplied the single next
scheduled date, so the endpoint always returned *something*, which is why
the feature looked like it was working: every symbol had an "upcoming"
marker, and nobody was checking whether the "past" ones were real absences
or a broken fetch. A code comment already admitted the missing dependency,
but nothing made the resulting emptiness distinguishable from real data, so
it was never escalated.

**Fixed** by declaring `lxml` as a proper dependency in `pyproject.toml` (not
just installing it by hand in production — that would not have survived a
redeploy), and by making the failure loud: a fetch failure on the
past-earnings path now sets a distinct `earnings_degraded` field (with the
exception type and message) on `MarketDataProvider.get_price_chart_events`'s
result and the `/api/live/events/{symbol}` response, logged at WARNING, so a
missing-dependency-style failure can never again present as "this symbol has
no earnings history." Modelled on the existing `SeriesFreshness`
(`src/data/macro.py`) / `FeedFailure` (`src/data/news.py`) convention: a
degraded source must be a distinguishable signal, never a silent collapse
into the same shape as a genuine empty result.

### 2026-09-12 — the automatic take-profit trim is deleted; the trailing stop is the only exit rule

**In plain words:** every midday, the desk used to sell 15% of any position
that was up 30% or more, automatically, before the reviewer looked at it.
That rule is gone. Nothing now sells a winner because of the size of its
gain. A position is exited by its trailing stop, by the reviewer citing a
real named trigger, or by a hard risk rule — never by a preset target.

**Why.** Two reasons, both owner doctrine (`docs/OUTCOME.md`, "No arbitrary
numbers, ever"):

- The 30% trigger and 15% trim were tuned off a SINGLE trade — a GOOGL trim
  that fired at +27% on 2026-04-30, as the function's own docstring said.
  Hindsight-tuning on n=1. Git shows the rule arriving upstream on
  2026-04-18 (`e61cc79`, 33% at +15%) and being re-tuned to 30%/15% on
  2026-05-01 (`ca3c409`); it predates QAMC (2026-08-09) and was never
  ratified against the desk's own principles.
- More fundamentally it was a **preset profit target**: sell a fixed
  fraction at a fixed gain, decided in advance, with no reference to what
  the instrument is actually doing. The owner removed exactly this class of
  logic when he removed reward:risk as a universal gate — the reward side of
  a trade cannot be predetermined because the holding period is unknown,
  and profit-taking belongs to a trailing stop. His ruling: *"Delete the
  live exit item, the only exit rule is trailing stop."*

**What changed.** `_auto_take_profit` and its midday wait-and-block helper
are deleted, along with the reviewer's "skip this symbol, an auto-TP sell is
in flight" path that existed only to serve it. There was no settings key or
config field for the rule (its numbers were hard-coded function defaults),
so there is nothing for a settings file to trip over. Historical
`TAKE_PROFIT` rows stay readable in the ledger, exit-audit and calibration
queries; nothing writes the label any more. The protection tests that had
used the auto trim as their vehicle now drive the shared partial-exit path
directly (`REDUCE`), so the invariant they pin — cancelled stops are
restored on a failed sell or re-placed on the true residual after a fill —
is unchanged. A new test fails if any fixed-gain automatic profit trim is
reintroduced anywhere under `src/`.

**What can still close or reduce a position, verified in code while
removing this:** the broker-resident GTC protective stop (fills written back
by the stop-out reconciler); the deterministic volatility/structure trailing
stop (`src/risk/trailing.py` — ratchets on swing lows, chandelier, and the
+1R breakeven move; never a fixed-gain sale); the reviewer's discretionary
SELL / REDUCE / COVER / TRAIL_STOP behind the named-trigger phrase gate,
the holding-discipline claim check and the risk-manager exit veto; the hard
risk rules (daily-loss circuit breaker at intra_check and session start,
force-delever ladder); ex-dividend stop adjustment (moves the stop only);
opportunity-cost rotation (dark by default, `rotation_enabled: false`); and
the cash-sweep parking vehicle's own SWEEP_SELL. None of them sells on a
fixed gain. The reviewer is still SHOWN fixed-percentage flags (drift at
weight > 12% and P&L > 10%, parabolic at >= 15% inside 3 days,
`TARGET_BREACH` at > 150% of planned move) but the prompt and the executor
both treat those as soft signals that can never justify an exit on their
own.

**`TradeDecision.take_profit` is not an order.** The broker's `submit_order`
accepts a `take_profit_price` argument, but no caller in the codebase passes
it, and the entry path submits only the limit price plus a post-fill
protective stop — the `TakeProfitRequest` import in `src/execution/broker.py`
is unused. The constructor's `take_profit` is written to the trade row and
shown to the reviewer as a reference (progress-to-target, distance-to-target)
and, for range setups only, to the execution-time reward:risk belt. Purely
informational; unchanged by this work.

## 2026-09-14 — the UNSOURCED token, written into a list field, discarded a whole earnings analysis

**In plain words:** the earnings prompt tells the model to write a
placeholder word when a number is missing from a filing. One of the places
it can write that word is a field our code expects to be a list, not a
word. When gemini-2.5-flash-lite did exactly that, the entire filing
analysis was thrown away, not just the one missing value.

`config/prompts/earnings_analyst.md` told the model to write
`[UNSOURCED:<reason>]` for any missing quantitative value, including
"revenue (total + YoY + segments)". `EarningsAnalysis.revenue.segments`
(`src/models.py`) is a LIST field. The model returned
`"segments": "[UNSOURCED:segment_data_not_disclosed]"` — a string where a
list was expected — pydantic raised `list_type`, and
`_validate_analysis` (`src/agents/earnings_analyst.py`) discarded the
entire analysis ("Invalid llm earnings analysis for MRVL"), losing every
other field the filing had correctly reported.

**What changed.** The prompt now says list fields (`segments`,
`management_highlights`, `key_initiatives`, etc.) get an empty list `[]`
when nothing is disclosed, and that the UNSOURCED token belongs only in
string fields — the note goes in `data_quality` instead. Separately,
`LLMOutputModel` (the base every LLM-parsed model inherits) now coerces a
bare UNSOURCED token on any `list[...]` field to `[]` rather than raising,
using the same "kept, not silently blanked" telemetry as the existing
null/empty-string coercion. The other four prompts that instruct the token
(`macro_analyst.md`, `news_analyst.md`, `evening_analyst.md`,
`portfolio_manager.md`) were audited: every field they point the token at
is `str`-typed, so only `earnings_analyst.md` had the mismatch.
`tests/test_models.py::test_unsourced_prompts_list_fields_tolerate_the_bare_token`
enforces this mechanically going forward — it walks every list-typed field
reachable from each of the five prompts' result models and asserts the
token coerces to `[]`, and
`test_every_unsourced_prompt_is_mapped_here` fails if a new prompt starts
using the token without being added to the audited set.

## 2026-09-17 — trimming a held stock to pay for a new one was read as buying more of it, and the whole plan was thrown out

**In plain words:** on an intraday check the portfolio manager chose to open
NET and pay for it by trimming AAPL. The safety check read the AAPL trim as a
purchase, found no fresh chart analysis for AAPL (the intraday scan only
analyses stocks that are moving), and rejected the entire plan. NET was never
bought.

Run `intra_check-44594a05`, 15:02 UTC. The PM asked NET at 1.75% risk and
AAPL at 1.0% risk, down from AAPL's current 1.91% equity at risk. Risk-based
targets state risk, not weight, and the grounding classifier had no view of a
holding's current risk, so it treated every non-zero risk target as an
increase on the theory that over-checking a trim is the safe mistake. It is
not safe on intraday runs: an increase needs a current-run Technical
analysis, the intraday scan analyses movers only, and a grounding error
fails the whole session rather than one target. Any trim of a held non-mover
would have rejected every valid entry alongside it.

**What changed.** The classifier now compares a risk target against the
holding's current stop-based risk — the same per-holding "equity at risk"
figure the PM is shown and the constructor rations against, already passed
into the PM. Below it, on the same side, is a trim. Everything else stays an
increase, and a holding whose current risk is unknown keeps the old strict
treatment. §9.3 conflict adjudication shares the classifier, so trims are now
exempt there too, as that rule always intended. Genuine increases and new
entries are checked exactly as before.

**Not changed, and still open.** One ungrounded target still rejects the whole
plan; dropping just that target is a design choice, not part of this fix.
The constructor also needs a current-run analysis to size any risk target, so
an intraday trim of a non-mover is expected to be dropped there as a data
fault and the holding left as it is — the new entry is no longer blocked, but
the trim that was meant to fund it may not happen.

**Follow-up, same day — the real plan was still rejected.** Replaying the
recorded plan showed a second barrier: AAPL's trim cited bullish earnings as
"supports", and the check demanded bearish evidence for any reduction.
Trimming a bullish holding for concentration is coherent — the evidence
supports holding what remains — so a PARTIAL trim may now be supported by
evidence on the side still held, as well as by evidence for reducing. Full
closes, opens and increases keep exactly the old polarity rule. With both
fixes the recorded plan passes grounding. Downstream, the constructor then
buys NET and drops the AAPL trim for lack of a current-run analysis; that
drop is recorded and paged as a "data fault", which misdescribes a working
feed. How a trim of an unanalysed holding should be sized is an open design
question, not fixed here.

**Second follow-up, same day — the trim now happens.** A trim of a held name
the session did not analyse is now sized from the position's own live broker
stop: shares kept = equity × target risk ÷ (price − live stop), the rest sold.
On the recorded plan that sells about 4.10 of AAPL's 9.763 shares (live stop
$315.85, price $332.96, equity $9,694.25) alongside the NET buy. Such a trim
can only reduce a position, never grow it. With no usable live stop the
position is still left unchanged, but it is now recorded as "trim could not be
sized — no usable live stop", not as a market-data fault, so the owner is no
longer paged to check a feed that was working, and the log no longer calls
the trim a BUY.

**Third follow-up, same day — quiet holds now get a chart.** The remaining
hole was not the trim classifier: a genuine add on a name the scan had not
charted still failed grounding and still voided the whole paid decision.
The midday scan now produces Technical for held names on the same call as
the movers. Dropping the ungrounded name is not the product. Write-up at
the top of this file, 2026-09-17, "the midday scan charted only the stocks
that jumped".

## 2026-09-17 — shorts carry the same limits as longs (owner decision)

Owner decision: "Shorts can have the same [limits] as longs." The desk is to
be fully invested long or short, and the two short-only caps were unsourced
numbers. `risk.max_single_short_pct` (10) was set as half the old long cap
and its own comment said it stood "until its own review";
`risk.max_gross_bearish_pct` (20) had no source either. Longs had no
equivalent total cap.

**What changed.** Both keys are deleted, and a settings file still carrying
one (or the older `max_short_gross_pct`) now fails to load. A short's
single-name cap is `max_position_pct`, the same setting and the same
hard-block rule name as a long, so the two cannot drift apart. Book exposure
either way stays bounded by `max_gross_exposure_x` and
`max_total_position_pct`. The PM and RM prompts no longer state short caps.

**Kept.** `short_gap_risk_multiple` (1.5) sizing haircut, the borrow gate,
the mandatory stop above entry, COVER never blocked, the kill switch and the
drawdown ladder.

## 2026-09-17 — six timers on one tick; two stop-coverage repairs raced

All six session timers (`quant-agent-{morning,midday,close,intra_check,
evening,earnings_preprocess}.timer`) carried `OnCalendar=*:0/30`, so every
one fired in the same second, every half hour. Measured consequences the
same day: morning and intra_check could race at 09:30 (ordering between two
timers firing in the same second is not guaranteed); and at 17:00:42 UTC
midday's own stop-coverage reconcile and intra_check's own stop-coverage
reconcile ran ~90ms apart — harmless because nothing needed repairing that
tick, but the same timing with a real gap present is how a repair placing a
stop collides with a session cancelling one to sell.

**What changed.** `quant-agent-intra_check.timer` moved to `OnCalendar=*:15,
45` — still a 30-minute cadence, inside the same 09:30-16:00 ET window, just
off the tick every other session shares. intra_check's exemptions in
`run_if_et_window.sh` (no once-per-day guard, no cross-mode session lock)
are unchanged. Separately, `src.coverage_watchdog.check_coverage` (the
standalone every-30-minute coverage-sweep unit and the 06:15 heartbeat —
never a live session's own repair) now defers its repair pass whenever
`src.execution.scale_in.trading_session_lock_held()` is true: a session
holding that lock already runs the identical repair
(`TradingPipeline._reconcile_stop_coverage`) itself, near the start of its
own run, so the tick that defers is not a tick that goes unprotected. The
gap is still read and still reported/alerted on; only the ADD is deferred.

**Not changed.** `quant-agent-coverage-sweep.timer` stays on `*:0/30` — it
is not part of `run_if_et_window.sh`'s window/lock machinery, and the new
`trading_session_lock_held()` gate handles its collision with
morning/midday/close/evening/earnings_preprocess directly. It does not see
`intra_check` (deliberately exempt from that lock), but intra_check no
longer shares its tick after the schedule move, so that pairing is closed
by timing instead. The separate, pre-existing race where a crashed morning
run leaves no completion stamp (so the desk treats morning as finished at
09:30 and the first paid intraday look can start at 10:00 while morning is
still retrying) is untouched by either change.

### 2026-09-17 — a 20% price band was applied to the stop, and it killed an approved short

**In plain words:** the desk has a fat-finger guard — it refuses an order
whose price is more than 20% away from the live quote, so a broken feed or a
hallucinated number cannot be traded. That band was also being applied to the
STOP price. A stop is supposed to sit outside the stock's normal daily
swings, so on a jumpy stock the stop is legitimately a long way from the
price, and the guard threw the trade away. On 17 September it threw away a
FLNC short that the analyst, the portfolio manager and the risk manager had
all already been paid to approve.

**Confirmed from the production log**, 2026-09-17 17:05:30: `SELL_SHORT FLNC
— stop_loss_price=$9.6600 deviates 24.1% from reference $7.79. Order
REJECTED`. The same run's risk manager had approved it ("FLNC short is
well-justified on technicals and earnings", R/R 1.51:1), and the desk's own
constructor had measured the stop at "2.50 x ATR over a 10-session horizon —
touch probability 20.7%". The stop was on the correct side, at a measured
width the desk itself judged reasonable. The guard was the only thing that
said no, and it said no after the money was spent.

**Where the number came from.** `OUTLIER_MAX_DEVIATION = 0.20` is inherited
from the upstream project (`ca4c51d9`, yebof, 2026-04-18) with no source. It
was never reviewed against this desk's doctrine.

**Why a flat percentage is the wrong shape of test for a stop.**

1. Wrong units. A stop's distance from entry is a volatility distance. FLNC's
   measured ATR(14) that session was $0.75 on a $7.785 price — 9.6% — so the
   flat band refused any stop wider than about 2.1x that stock's ordinary
   daily range. On a $500 name with a 1% ATR the same band permits twenty
   such ranges. It bans nothing on a quiet stock and bans real structure on a
   volatile one.
2. It only caught the safe direction. Sizing is risk-based
   (`_qty_by_risk_budget`: `risk_per_share = abs(entry - stop)`, `qty = risk
   dollars / risk_per_share`), so a WIDER stop makes the position SMALLER.
   The extreme case is self-limiting: a $0.01 stop under a $300 long makes
   risk-per-share almost the whole share price, so the quantity collapses to
   the authorised risk budget divided by the price and the worst case — the
   stock to zero — loses exactly the budget that was approved. The dangerous
   error is a too-TIGHT stop, which inflates size, and a deviation band never
   caught that at all: a tight stop sits close to the reference by
   definition.

**What changed.** The 20% band now applies only to the price the order
actually transacts at — the entry/limit price, the one whose corruption makes
quantity sizing nonsense. Nothing about the band itself moved; only what it
is applied to. The take-profit branch went with it (no caller has ever passed
`take_profit_price`).

**What the stop gets instead, at the same boundary.** Two checks that need no
number: the stop must be a finite, positive number, and it must be on the
correct side of the entry. Both refuse the order. The finiteness check also
closes a separate hole found while doing this: `_quantize_price` maps NaN and
Inf to `None`, which made `use_stop` False, so a non-finite stop used to
submit the entry with NO protective stop at all, silently. Finiteness is now
read before quantization.

**What still protects a stop's WIDTH, unchanged.** The constructor measures
it in the instrument's own ATR: `_widen_stop_past_noise` pushes an unbacked
stop out to `min_stop_atr_multiple` (2.5) ATRs, honours a stop that sits on a
computed structural level however tight down to
`absolute_min_stop_atr_multiple` (1.0) ATR, and refuses a wrong-side or
non-finite stop outright. `_qty_by_risk_budget` independently refuses invalid
geometry. Spec §12.1 — honour a level-backed stop however tight, apply the
volatility floor only when nothing computed backs it — is untouched by this
change and was the reason not to write a new floor here.

**No replacement number was invented for the stop, and none should be.** A
percentage band on a stop has no published source, and fitting one to past
trades would not make it non-arbitrary. If an absolute sanity bound on a stop
is ever wanted, what would source it is a measured distribution of the
desk's own realised stop widths in ATR terms per name — a reading, not a fit
— and that is deliberately left unbuilt.

**The wording, second half of the same fix.** A refusal used to read "stop
$9.66 is 24% from price $7.79". A bare percentage is not judgeable: 24% is an
outrage on a utility and an ordinary two sessions on a $7 stock, and the
owner reasonably read a correct refusal as a bug. The message now carries the
stock's own measured daily range beside the deviation — "limit price $4.96 is
36% from price $7.79 — FLNC normally moves about $0.75 (10%) in a day" — from
the ATR(14) the desk had already computed for that symbol and passed down
from the entry stage. It is used for wording only; no code path branches on
it, and when the caller has no ATR (the resume and sweep lanes carry no
analysis) the range clause is omitted rather than filled with an invented
number.

**Alerting.** A stop refusal is a separate skip reason (`unusable_stop`) from
a price refusal (`fat_finger_guard`), so the owner is never told a price was
"too far from the market" when what actually happened is the stop could never
have worked. Both still say the desk blocked it, not the broker.

**Found while doing this, reported and LEFT ALONE.** A `stop_loss_price` of
exactly `0.0` is this codebase's sentinel for "no stop", so the entry submits
unprotected — pinned by `test_submit_order_buy_with_zero_stop_loss_skips_oto`.
It is the same shape of hole as the NaN one, but it is explicit rather than
silent, it pre-dates this work, and the production entry callsite already
passes `None` rather than `0`, so nothing live reaches it. Not closed here.
Separately, the fat-finger guard and its 2026-09-17 plain-words rewording had
no write-up in these docs at all before this entry.

**Not changed.** The 20% band's value. The kill switch. The constructor's ATR
floors or the §12.1 level exemption. Nothing about how wide a stop is allowed
to be. The `0.0` sentinel.

## The de-levering ladder was reading a shallower drawdown than the account really had, and an erased equity curve read as a book at record highs (2026-09-18)

**In plain language.** The desk automatically reduces how much it owns once it
falls far enough below its best-ever value. To do that it has to know what its
best-ever value was. It was reading that from a table with a hole in it, so it
thought the account was 1.3% below its high when it was really 2.7% below — and
the error can only ever go that way, because a missing row can only make the
"best ever" look smaller than it was. Worse: if that table were ever emptied
completely, the desk reported 0.0% — no drawdown at all — which looks exactly
like a book at record highs, holds the loosest possible limit, and says nothing
to anybody. Losing the records and doing brilliantly produced identical output.

**The one-directional error.** `peak_to_trough_pct` (`src/risk/rules.py`) takes
`max()` over the stored `daily_pnl` history plus today's equity, and
`resolve_gross_ceiling` reads the result. A missing row can only lower the peak,
never raise it, so a hole in the table always produces a SHALLOWER drawdown and
a LOOSER exposure ceiling than the ratified ladder intends. That is a safety
error, not noise.

**What was actually missing, and where it came from.** The live `daily_pnl`
table held four rows, earliest 2026-09-02 at 9862.74. The desk reset of
2026-09-02 (`data/resets/20260902T181859Z/`) deleted 13 rows **by design** — its
own `reset_manifest.json` records `{"table": "daily_pnl", "rows": 13,
"deleting": 13}` — and took a full database snapshot beside the manifest first.
Those 13 rows run 2026-08-14 to 2026-09-01 and peak at **10005.68 on
2026-08-20**. The account was not restarted by that reset: it flattened
positions to cash on the same paper account (`PA3DFXH9FF5V` in both
`book_before.json` and `book_after.json`), with equity running 9870.37 (08-27
close) -> 9865.27 (pre-flatten) -> 9864.04 (post-flatten) -> 9862.74 (09-02
close) and no capital added or removed. A high-water mark is a property of the
account's capital, not of the strategy record the reset discarded, so 10005.68
is this account's real high.

**Correction to the brief that raised this.** The obvious restore source looked
like `data/quant_agent.db.bak-20260828T151630`, which holds 10 of those rows.
The reset's own snapshot holds all 13, including 2026-08-28, 2026-08-31 and
2026-09-01, which the 08-28 backup predates. Restoring from the backup would
have left a three-day hole. The snapshot was used instead.

**What was restored.** All 13 rows, by `scripts/restore_daily_pnl_history.py`
— dry run by default, idempotent (`INSERT OR IGNORE` on the `date` primary
key), and it copies the target database before writing so the change is
reversible. **Nothing was invented.** 2026-09-03 and the 2026-09-04..09-14 desk
pause have no row in either database and were left absent: `daily_pnl` is
written only by an evening run, `llm_budget_sessions` shows no desk activity
across that window, and interpolating a row would fabricate an equity reading.

**Measured effect.** Against the last stored equity (9734.50, 2026-09-17 close)
the ladder read **-1.30%** before and reads **-2.71%** after. The resolved
ceiling is 2.0x in both cases — the first rung is -8% — so **no trading
behaviour changed today.** What changed is that the ladder is now measuring
against the account's real high instead of a truncated one.

**The worse half, and the fix.** With no usable prior reading at all,
`peak_to_trough_pct` used to leave today's equity alone in the list, make it its
own high-water mark, and return a confident `0.0`. `resolve_gross_ceiling` reads
`0.0` as "inside the no-de-levering band" and holds the standing cap, so a
data-loss event silently disabled the desk's only automatic seller while every
log line and owner-facing message reported a healthy book. `peak_to_trough_pct`
now returns UNMEASURABLE (`None`) when there is no usable PRIOR reading — empty
history, or a history whose every entry was dropped as non-finite — and warns.
`resolve_gross_ceiling`'s unknown branch now sets `alert_owner=True`.

**Why the ceiling in that state was NOT tightened.** Following the precedent
already in this area: `apply_gross_ceiling` marks an unreadable book
UNMEASURABLE and trims nothing. Tightening to a rung would be picking a number
for a state in which, by definition, nothing has been measured, and would
force-liquidate the genuinely-fresh-account case `resolve_gross_ceiling`'s
docstring exists to protect. Holding the loosest cap was never the defect;
doing it in silence was.

**Why the boundary is zero prior readings and not N days.** Zero is the line
between measured and unmeasured — it is not a number anyone picked. Whether a
short-but-non-empty curve (two or three days after a reset) is long enough to
carry a meaningful high-water mark is a real and separate question with a real
answer somewhere in the desk's own data; no `min_history=N` was smuggled in as
if it had been answered.

**A second defect found and fixed in passing.** The owner-facing leverage alert
printed "DRAWDOWN PAST -20%" for every `alert_owner` state. Since 2026-09-02
that already included the bad-equity-read state, which has no measured drawdown
at all — so the owner could be told a specific, false number about his own book.
The message is now chosen from the rung: a state that was never measured reports
UNMEASURABLE and no number, and the empty-curve case says outright that this is
NOT a book at record highs.

**A test that pinned the old behaviour was replaced, deliberately.**
`test_peak_to_trough_pct_all_history_corrupted_still_returns_a_number_not_nan`
documented the all-history-corrupted -> 0.0 fallback as an accepted residual
("the ladder still functions"). It was the same defect in a second doorway and
is now pinned the other way.

**Not changed.** No threshold, rung or trade-governing number. `GROSS_LADDER`
and `GROSS_LADDER_ALERT_PCT` are untouched. The ladder's order type, its 1%
limit buffer, and its sequencing of cancels, sells and stop placement are
untouched — the sell-instrument question is filed as board item 119, with the
order type explicitly left alone.
