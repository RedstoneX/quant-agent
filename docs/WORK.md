# QAMC Current Work

## Active finish line

### Session start — read this first

**STANDING PRINCIPLE — NO ARBITRARY NUMBERS, EVER.** Every trade constant comes from real data, a cited source, or the instrument itself — never a flat count, round % or a number that "sounds prudent". **Approval does not make a flat number non-arbitrary.** Mark unmeasured numbers provisional, never settled.

**STANDING PRINCIPLE — MISSING DATA IS A DEFECT IN THE PRODUCING STEP (owner 2026-09-17).** Find why a required field is blank and fix that step so it actually produces the data. Never invent. Never make skip/drop/ignore-and-continue the product. A drop-the-name quarantine is temporary. Item 78 is the current instance; the rule is not limited to it. Fuller statement: `docs/OUTCOME.md`.

**This file holds only open work.** Finished work is written up in `docs/INCIDENT_HISTORY.md` (append-only, each entry opening with one plain-language line) and then deleted here, together with its `## item N` block in `docs/board_notes/` and its NUMBER — the number alone, never a reason — added to the retired line. `tests/test_status_board.py` fails if this file passes 100,000 bytes, if one change grows it by more than the shrinking growth budget its current fullness allows (owner ruling 2026-09-17: recording a genuine new defect must not be blocked just because nothing is finished yet to prune — see `work_md_growth_budget` in `scripts/status_board.py`), if a self-declared-finished item is left sitting on the board, or if it loses an item number without retiring it. Ratified architecture decisions go in `docs/QAMC_REMEDIATION_SPEC.md` as a numbered phase, not here.

## DECISIONS PENDING — CI FAILS WHEN ONE GOES OVERDUE

**Do not delete a line to pass the build — decide it, then remove it in the SAME commit.** Format: `- [ ] DECIDE BY YYYY-MM-DD — question` (`test_no_pending_decision_is_overdue` parses it). It exists because a deferred decision was forgotten in 2026-08 and cost a zero-trade day.

**RESOLVED 2026-09-25 — the mandate is SWING (days to weeks), not a quarterly-horizon value book.** Decided by the orchestrator after an adversary run, per the 2026-09-18 ruling that this question does not wait on the owner. Reason: `docs/OUTCOME.md:75` already rules the desk's horizon "swing — days to weeks"; `config/prompts/tech_analyst.md:3` already treats its own 5-15d window as signal-validity, not holding period, with PM/position_reviewer owning the hold; holding period is an OUTPUT of thesis health, not a setting. `config/prompts/evening_analyst.md` and `config/prompts/meta_reflector.md` carried un-migrated rot from the original upstream value mandate (medium-long-term/quarterly-horizon framing) and have been rewritten to match. Detail and the exact prose diff: `docs/board_notes/` ("item 99").

- [ ] DECIDE BY 2026-10-31 — Which model should run the desk's actual trade-decision seat?
  **Owner ruling 2026-09-13:** no model comparison until the job board is clean. The date exists only because this format needs one; it moves rather than forcing a decision. **Nobody proposes the run or its spend to him — he raises it or it does not happen.** Incumbent `openai/gpt-5.5` stays until a first run exists. Owner decision 2026-09-15 goes further: no test-environment work at all unless he asks. The seat is ~93% of the LLM bill. Verified detail 2026-09-14: `docs/INCIDENT_HISTORY.md` and `docs/board_notes/`. Absorbs retired board item 77 (a bare pointer at this line; routing detail in `docs/architecture/MODEL_ROUTING_POLICY.md`; it closes with this line and is not answered twice).

**RECONFIRM AFTER A FEW DAYS LIVE — `max_calls_per_session: 40` (owner instruction 2026-09-03).** The cost circuit's runaway-loop defence, set from real data (worst complete session: 14 calls). A first number, not final. Once live sessions exist, re-pull `llm_budget_sessions.logical_calls`; raise it if a legitimate session gets close, never lower it on a hunch. History: `docs/INCIDENT_HISTORY.md`, "item 14".

## PM TEST GATE — GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT

The PM model test means nothing until everything feeding the PM is clean; this gate blocks the model decision above. Cleared items are written up and deleted.

**The gate is EMPTY as of 2026-09-14 — every PM-gate item is closed, and the owner's condition (no model test runs while any gate item is open) is met.** Gate item 7 moved to the backlog as item 76.

<!-- END PM TEST GATE -->

**Alert design (owner rule 2026-09-02).** Every failure alerts in its OWN Telegram message, never bundled into a run summary; severity is carried in TEXT, never colour; deliberately not deduplicated — a still-broken seat keeps alerting.

**Rehearsal rig — do not run it unless the owner asks (owner decision 2026-09-15, which retired test-environment work).** `ops/rehearsal/` replays a session offline; usage, flags and caveats are in `ops/rehearsal/README.md`. The one caveat worth carrying here: it cannot validate a prompt rewrite, because it replays recorded answers into a changed prompt and passes regardless.

**Production.** Mission Control is `https://ovh-vps.wallaby-bowfin.ts.net/cockpit/` (Tailscale Serve to the loopback API). **A `git checkout` on the box is not a deploy:** restart `quant-agent-api.service`, then confirm the hashed bundle filename the server returns matches the one under `src/api/static_cockpit/assets/`. Never record a production SHA here; read it: `sudo -n -u qamc git -C /home/qamc/quant-agent log --oneline -1` (and `status --porcelain` for config drift, expected empty).

**Standing cautions.** The pre-2026-08-27 LLM-spend baseline is contaminated by runaway loops — build no allocation conclusion on it. Model-market strategy (champion/challenger) is TABLED by owner decision 2026-08-27. The PM's "Proposal Conversion" block reads 21 days of history the 2026-09-02 reset erased: a quiet block means "no data yet", not "no stuck loops".

**Engineering setup.** Work as `ubuntu`, never as `qamc`. No venv in engineering checkouts: use `/home/ubuntu/projects/quant-agent/.venv/bin/python` with `PYTHONPATH` at the checkout root and the five dummy API-key env vars CI uses. Read the live box with `sudo -n -u qamc`. Log timestamps are **UTC**; the owner is **ET** — convert before quoting times to him.

**Working agreement.** Standing autonomy to execute the backlog without stopping at phase gates. Interrupt only for live-capital activation, new paid dependencies, secrets redesign, destructive infrastructure, or evidence a ratified decision was wrong. The grant covers executing, not expanding: report breakage that predates your task in plain language and let the owner decide. Never state a date or duration from impression — take it from `git log` and check the author (everything before **2026-08-09** is upstream `yebof`). The desk board (`docs/phases.yaml`, `/board`) is a source of truth; defects go on it. Orchestrate: delegate at task START (cheapest tier for docs and inventory, mid tier for bounded implementation, strongest for trading/risk logic), read diffs not whole files, never two writing agents in one worktree, and verify the single load-bearing claim of every agent report (check the test count; reproduce the cause) — a confidently wrong root cause was caught only that way on 2026-08-29.

**Operational facts.**
- Stage explicit paths; never `git add -A`. Never bare `git stash` — the ref is repo-global across worktrees; use `git stash push -m "<name>"` and pop by index, or a throwaway worktree.
- Branch protection requires the `pytest` check to pass but does NOT require an up-to-date branch [verified 2026-09-18: `required_status_checks.strict` is `false`, contexts `["pytest"]`, `enforce_admins` true]. So pull requests may be merged IN PARALLEL — do not rebase each one onto `main` first. Merge `main` in only when there is a real conflict. Never `--admin`, never force-push. The previous wording here claimed up-to-date branches were required; that was false and made every agent serialise merges against a restriction that does not exist.
- `gh pr edit` and `gh pr view` fail on this repo (deprecated Projects-classic field). Use `gh api repos/RedstoneX/quant-agent/pulls/N -X PATCH` (body from a file: see `AGENTS.md`).
- Agents stall on polling loops: give every agent an explicit polling budget, or poll yourself.
- **A deploy installs the schedule.** `scripts/merge_and_deploy.sh` checks out `origin/main`, copies any changed or new `scripts/systemd/*.service`/`*.timer` into the qamc user's systemd dir, runs `daemon-reload`, enables what is not on `paused_units.yaml`, then restarts the API service (item 122 fix, 2026-09-24; before that the copy was by hand). **This is NOT silent:** `quant-agent-unit-drift.service` byte-compares every repo unit against the installed one and alerts on Telegram (it reported "in sync, 30 units" on 2026-09-18). Board item 122 carries the defect.
- **Never hand-resolve a conflict in `docs/WORK.md`, `docs/board_notes/` or `docs/INCIDENT_HISTORY.md`.** They use `scripts/resolve_doc_conflict.py` as a git merge driver (`.gitattributes` + `scripts/git_merge_driver_docs.sh`; one-time per-clone `git config` in README.md "### Install"). **Markers now mean one of two things** (changed 2026-09-23): no driver configured, or the driver REFUSED — a refusal writes markers plus a gitignored `<doc>.merge-refusal` beside the file carrying the reason, which is how you tell them apart; it used to write NOTHING and leave your own stale copy looking resolved. The resolver merges numbered ITEMS, refuses unless every item on either side survives exactly once, and stops on a number collision (a renumber, never a delete); refusing is correct. Hand-resolving is how five live items were deleted (item 68). The CLI (`--from-index`, or `--kind`/`--base`/`--ours`/`--theirs`/`--out`) works without the driver, including dry runs.

### Ordered backlog — RESUME POINT

**PRIORITY ORDER, set 2026-09-17 (the owner authorised the ordering). Work it top-down — it overrides item-number order.**
- **Tier 1, can cost money or hide risk:** 89 (its residue), 80, 90, 111, 112, 127, 199, 201. (87 and 88 closed 2026-09-18; 130 retired 2026-09-25.)
- **Tier 2, wastes money or opportunity:** 91, 82, 81, 92.
- **Tier 3, clarity and hygiene:** 89 (its thirteen clarity defects), 94. (93 retired 2026-09-25.)
- **To be decided by the orchestrator after an adversary run, not parked on the owner (ruling 2026-09-18 — his words: "I don't want you waiting on me on anything. You have the adversary in my place. Just make sure it gets documented." The adversary argues, it never rules; the orchestrator decides and records the decision and its reason before anything is built on it):** 86. (109(a) closed 2026-09-26 — the OWNER ruled it himself on 2026-09-25, so it never took the delegated route; item 109(c) retired 2026-10-01. 96 retired 2026-09-25 — the delegated question is stale, the veto it asked about is built and wired. 95 retired 2026-09-26 — decided yes, under the already-ratified cap and ladder, with the cost of the debit now shown to the seat.)

## THE FUNNEL QUEUE — why trades do not happen, ranked by measured cost

**Top of the backlog. Work the PRIORITY ORDER above; do not reorder from intuition.** The original census items (ranks 1-8) are all retired and written up; the measured census that ranked them is in `docs/INCIDENT_HISTORY.md`.
