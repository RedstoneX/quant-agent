# its own schema comment states it holds "already-VALIDATED structured
# evidence... never raw LLM prose" — reusing it for raw/invalid payloads
# would violate a documented invariant Mission Control relies on. A small
# append-only JSON-per-failure directory, written with the same atomic
# tmp+rename discipline as news_store/macro_store/tech_store/earnings_analyst
# (see earnings_analyst._save_analysis), is the simplest mechanism that is
# both durable and trivially inspectable (`ls`, `cat`, `jq`) without a DB

    NEVER raises. This is purely a forensic-display gap fix (mirrors
    `_persist_evidence`'s "NEVER raises" contract in pipeline_stages.py):
    a disk-write failure here (full disk, permissions, whatever) must only
    log a warning and let the ORIGINAL error/failure path continue exactly
    as it would have without this call — never mask or replace it.

    `parsed` is the JSON-decoded object at the point of failure (already
    dict/list — NOT re-serialized from raw_text) when JSON parsing itself
    succeeded but pydantic validation failed; None when JSON parsing never
    succeeded (raw_text alone is then the only evidence). Keeping both
    lets a later reader tell "the JSON was malformed" apart from "the JSON
    was well-formed but the wrong shape" — the exact ambiguity that made
    the 2026-09-02 four-missing-fields failure undiagnosable from the log
    line alone.

    `affected_symbols` (board item 152) names the stocks that lose this seat
    because of this failure — the symbols the seat was shown real headline
    text for. Recorded here so the dump answers "which names are now missing
    their news seat, and why" on its own, rather than leaving a later reader
    to reconstruct it from a rotated log line and a count.
