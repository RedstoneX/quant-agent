        schema validation (e.g. a mandatory reasoning_chain field omitted).

        Production incident 2026-08-18 15:03: the Risk Manager APPROVED the
        day's plan with three sensible halving modifications, but omitted
        `sizing_sanity` and `overall` from its reasoning_chain — validation
        failed, the verdict became None, and RiskStage recorded
        "REJECTED: parse error". A prose omission silently destroyed an
        approving verdict and ended the trading day. One corrective call
        (~$0.002) names the exact validation errors and asks the model to
        complete the object; if the second attempt also fails, callers
        keep their existing fail-closed path (None → reject/retry).

        This is SCHEMA COMPLETION, never re-decision. The coda explicitly
        scopes the model to filling missing/invalid narrative fields and
        forbids touching any decision-bearing value. That instruction is
        advisory, not enforcement — callers MUST additionally verify the
        repaired parse's decision-bearing fields are byte-identical to the
        pre-repair parse (see `RiskManagerAgent`/`PortfolioManagerAgent`)

        was itself rooted in a decision-bearing field (in which case

        (_try_failover). `_call_openai` is a thin wrapper over this for the
        primary path.

        STREAMED on purpose. The OPENAI_BASE_URL relay sits behind
        Cloudflare, whose ~120s Proxy Read Timeout (HTTP 524) kills any call
        that sends zero bytes until the model finishes — and PM / tech /
        evening generations legitimately run 120s+, so non-streaming could
        never succeed through the relay (the 2026-06-08/09 outage: every long
        call 524'd, book froze sell-only). Streaming keeps bytes flowing so
        the proxy window never trips; _LLM_HTTP_TIMEOUT becomes a per-chunk
        read timeout, so a long *healthy* generation isn't axed either.

        The semaphore covers create + iteration: for a streamed response the
        request is in flight (and counts against a relay's per-user
        concurrency cap) until the last chunk is read. OpenRouter and Google
        are each a distinct account/rate-limit domain, so each gets its own
