# Per-provider in-flight caps around the LLM HTTP call itself (NOT around
# run() — building the user message / parsing must never hold a slot).
#
# Why: the relay enforces a per-user concurrency cap, and morning fans out
# macro + news + tech (multi-chunk) + earnings through a
# ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) on one relay account — the fan-out
# self-inflicted "Concurrency limit exceeded" 429 storms (175 occurrences in
# the 06-16..06-29 logs), and each kill-looped morning re-spawned the full
# team into the already-limited relay. A module-level semaphore serializes
# the excess instead of bouncing it off the server. Anthropic is direct
# (no relay) so it gets a looser, independent cap — failover calls must not
# queue behind a wedged relay slot.

# --- tokens per minute, the limit the semaphores above never bounded -------
#
# A concurrency cap counts REQUESTS. A provider rate limit counts TOKENS per
# minute. Three concurrent 80,000-token requests satisfy a cap of three and
# are exactly what gets declined, which is how the Technical Analyst could
# send ~314,000 tokens in 80 seconds (~252k/min) while every cap in the
# system read as green. It was the only agent ever rate-limited: eleven times
# in three weeks, with no other agent declined once.
#
# This is a BACKSTOP, not the mechanism. The actual fix is that requests are
# now built to a size budget rather than cut to a fixed item count (see
# src/token_budget.py): the largest request a morning pass can produce fell
# from ~136,000 tokens to ~44,700, so even all three concurrent slots full
# is ~134k/min — under this ceiling by construction, not by luck.
#
# The ceiling exists for what the budget cannot see: a new agent, a prompt
# that grows, a retry storm. 150k/min sits below the ~252k/min burst that
# was actually being refused and above anything the packer can now emit, so
# in normal operation it must never fire. If it does, that is a bug report
# about something having grown — and it says exactly that, at CRITICAL.
#
# Deliberately NOT the primary control: pacing against a guessed ceiling
# means discovering the real limit by being refused, and every refusal is
# paid for. Sizing the request before it leaves costs nothing.

# Google AI Studio direct (project qamc-gemini) free tier, READ OFF THE
# OWNER'S OWN AI STUDIO DASHBOARD 2026-08-31: 15 RPM / 250,000 TPM / 500 RPD.
# Published blog figures (1,000-1,500 RPD) are WRONG for this project; the
# dashboard is authoritative. TPM is the BINDING constraint, not RPD: a
# morning pass is ~215,000 tokens — 86% of the per-minute ceiling in a single
# burst — while RPD at ~76 requests/day against 500 is a non-issue.
#
# 200,000 is 80% of that measured 250,000 TPM ceiling, not a guessed number —
# the owner's explicit objection to an earlier ceiling was that it was chosen
# by taste rather than derived from a published/measured limit. A 6-request
# test at ~253k tokens BREACHED the real ceiling (recorded on the dashboard,
# though the calls happened to still succeed) — "no error" is not "no
# limit", so this stays a genuine safety margin, not a number tuned to the
# last incident.

# tokens for ~355,000 characters of OHLCV rows), nothing like the ~4 that
# prose gives. Estimating at 1.5 stays conservative for that case rather than
# under-charging the very requests the governor exists to bound; prose is
# over-charged, which only costs a little headroom on agents that send a
# twentieth as much. Every charge is reconciled to the provider's real usage
# the moment the response lands, so this constant only ever affects one
# request's wait decision, never the window's accuracy.

# finish/stop reasons that mean "output hit a ceiling mid-generation".
# Shared by the truncation flag in _execute() and the empty-content guards:
# an empty body WITH one of these reasons is a legitimate truncation (e.g. a
# reasoner burning the whole budget on CoT) that must surface as
# truncated=True, NOT trigger retry/failover (truncation never fails over —
# see CLAUDE.md). insufficient_system_resource is DeepSeek-specific: the
# inference system ran out of resources and returned a cut-off body on a 200.
