        rules the LLM occasionally violates by self-inflating.

        Both rules used to be CALENDAR-DAY tests and both were wrong for
        macro data. Rule 2 required `staleness_days <= 1` on two of the six
        primary indicators; FRED's real publication lag on its daily series
        is about 2 business days, so the bar demanded a print that does not
        exist and the rule fired on 14 of 27 retained production runs (52%,
        2026-08-17..09-02) — the macro seat's regime call was being thrown
        away about half the time for being punctual. Rule 1 had the same
        shape at a looser number (>3 daily, >55 monthly). Full reasoning,
        the measurement, and what replaced the day count:
        `src/data/macro.py::SeriesFreshness`.

        The test now is the one that matches how macro data actually
        publishes: an indicator counts when it is the LATEST PUBLISHED
        reading for its series and no newer print is overdue. A CPI figure
        five weeks old is the current figure; a daily yield two days behind
        is the current yield. What does NOT count is an indicator that is
        missing, or one whose next print is past due by that series' own
        measured cadence and publication lag (a publication failure, a
        fetch failure, a shutdown) — that is real staleness and it still
        blocks, which is the half of the old gate worth keeping.

        1. `confidence == "high"` requires all six primary indicators to
           be present with a usable reading and none overdue. ("high" is
           the LLM's most-impactful confidence call; PM's Step 1
           evening-tilt scales sizing by it, so a self-inflated "high" on
           absent data leaks into position size.)

        2. `regime_shift == True` requires >= 2 primary indicators
           present and not overdue, per the prompt's "Regime-Shift
           Detection" rule. Below that, clear `regime_shift` and
           `shift_reason` — calling a flip when the data is missing is
           guessing, and PM treats `regime_shift=true` as a "size
           appropriately and name the flip" trigger.

        Logs a warning on each override so the operator can see WHICH
        side of the gate misbehaved (LLM ignored prompt rule vs the
        sanity check fired correctly).
