"""Render a standing instruction sheet's risk limits from the live config.

THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. The AI Risk Manager's standing sheet
(`config/prompts/risk_manager.md`) stated the desk's limits as hand-typed
prose. Nothing tied that prose to `config/settings.yaml`, which is what the
deterministic engine actually enforces, so the two drifted — provably, twice:

  * the sheet told the reviewer the long single-name ceiling was 33% while
    `risk.max_position_pct` had been 65 since 2026-09-11 (owner override).
    Every plan for two days was audited against a ceiling less than half the
    real one.
  * the same sheet told the seat a 1.5 reward:risk floor was "the number to
    enforce" months after the floor stopped being a gate — the named cause of
    three of the four whole-plan vetoes in the archived database (fixed
    separately, PR #341).

The pattern is not "someone forgot to update the prompt". It is that a limit
had TWO homes and only one of them was mechanically enforced. This module
gives it one: the sheet carries `{{risk.<field>}}` placeholders, and the
value is read at run time off the same `RiskConfig` the engine is built from.

FAIL LOUD, NEVER BLANK. A placeholder naming a setting that does not exist
raises `PromptPlaceholderError` rather than rendering an empty string or a
stale default. A risk reviewer briefed with "the single-name ceiling is %"
is worse than one briefed with a wrong number, because nothing downstream
can see that it happened. The pipeline builds the agent at startup, so the
failure surfaces before any capital is at risk.

Scope is deliberately narrow: numeric fields on `src.config.RiskConfig` (and
a short allowlist of its COMPUTED properties, which are derivations of those
fields rather than independent numbers). No other namespace resolves. This
module holds no copy of any limit's value — only the rules for reading one.

#: `config/prompts/tech_analyst.md` already carries `{{tech.bars_per_symbol}}`,
#: which `PLACEHOLDER_RE` matches but this module cannot resolve. That sheet is
#: rendered by `src/agents/tech_analyst.py` instead (a code constant, not a
#: settings key, and that seat is the only one allowed to halt the desk — the
#: raise below would be a halt). Sending it through here without first adding a
#: `tech` namespace raises `PromptPlaceholderError` at agent construction. Item
#: 107(c) widened the mechanism's COVERAGE (`audit_prompt_coverage` now checks
#: all ten sheets) without widening what it substitutes: `tech` is declared in
#: `PROMPT_NAMESPACES` as another renderer's business, and this is still the
#: trap if anyone routes that sheet through `LiveLimitPrompt`.
RISK_NAMESPACE = "risk"

#: A second namespace, added for board item 107. It resolves NAMED CONSTANTS
#: in `src.risk.metrics` rather than settings fields, because the numbers it
#: carries have no settings key — the drift flag's weight and P&L
#: thresholds. Naming them here is what lets the prose that describes the
#: flag render from the same pair the flag is computed from, closing the
#: "three homes" half of item 107.
#:
#: This namespace is NOT a place to park a number so that it looks
#: governed. Every entry must be a module-level constant that real code
#: reads at run time; a value that only a prompt ever uses belongs in
#: settings or nowhere (item 107(b)).

#: Every prompt sheet on disk, and what is responsible for its placeholders.
#: Item 107(c): the rendering mechanism reached 2 of 10 sheets and nothing
#: said what covered the other eight, so a sheet could be added carrying a
#: placeholder nobody substitutes and the desk would ship `{{...}}` to a
#: paid model. `audit_prompt_coverage` refuses an unlisted sheet, so the ten
#: are covered by name and an eleventh cannot appear unregistered.
#:
#: The value is the set of namespaces that sheet is allowed to use. An
#: EMPTY set means "this sheet carries no placeholders at all" and is
#: enforced as such — it is coverage, not an exemption.
#:
#: `tech` is declared for the tech sheet alone and is deliberately NOT
#: resolvable here: `src/agents/tech_analyst.py` renders those three from a
#: code constant and from the run's own lookback, and routing that sheet
#: through `render_prompt_limits` would raise at construction on the one
#: seat allowed to halt the desk. The audit knows the difference between
#: "resolved here" and "resolved by a named other renderer".
