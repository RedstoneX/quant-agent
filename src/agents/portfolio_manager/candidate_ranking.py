        These are the pre-decision halves of the gates this class and the
        constructor already enforce after submission, restated so the prompt

              "R/R must be measurable or a catalyst row names the symbol".
              Neither is a block. A range ratio, including None, is ranking
              information. A breakout is not measured on reward:risk. The
              `rr_floor` argument is accepted and ignored so callers do not
              silently re-default a retired number. Catalyst is not an
              admission door.
          R5  net independent source score ≥ 1 for the proposed direction
              (`signed_source_score`; §9.4 refuses net ≤ 0 outright —
              `agreement_refuses_trade`, a refusal gate with no schedule
              and no config behind it since 2026-09-14)
          R6  the constructor's own preview REFUSED this name by code
              (`constructor_refusals_by_symbol`, a snapshot of
              `PortfolioConstructor.last_refusals` taken after
              `real_reward_risk_preview` ran over every analysis) — today
              `no_structural_stop_and_no_volatility_reading` (docs/WORK.md
              item 180 dropped the young-listing bar-count refusal, and
              item 56 deleted the stop-WIDTH refusal
              `stop_wider_than_instrument_reach` on 2026-09-26 — a wide
              stop is answered by a smaller position, never a refusal).
              The enforcing check is one stage later, in the ONE funnel
              construction shares with the preview; this only stops the PM
              being shown a name that funnel has already refused. Absent
              structure is NOT a reason — the earlier "no floor, no trade"
              R6 was replaced the day it shipped, on sourced research.

        R1 (current technical coverage) is implied: only symbols with an
        analysis in `analyses` are considered at all. Nothing here removes or
        weakens a gate — a name this admits can still be dropped after
        submission by the stricter post-decision checks.

        **R4's number, 2026-09-04 fix.** `real_reward_risk_by_symbol` — when
        supplied, keyed by upper-case symbol — is
        `PortfolioConstructor.real_reward_risk_preview`'s output: the SAME
        derived-target, noise-floor-widened reward:risk `construct_orders`
        gates on, not `TechAnalysisResult.risk_reward` (the analyst's own
        guessed target, real arithmetic but never checked against
        structure). A 2026-09-04 audit found this gate and the
        constructor's real one passing DISJOINT sets on a real day — zero
        overlap — because this gate ran first and screened candidates on a
        different number than the one that would decide them one stage
        later. A symbol absent from the map is treated as `None` (fail
        closed, same as an unmeasurable ratio always has been here).
        Omitted entirely (`None`), this falls back to `analysis.risk_reward`
        for callers that have not wired a constructor preview through
        (rare — pre-existing tests, and any harness with no
        `PortfolioConstructor` instance to hand); production always
        supplies it.

        2026-09-03: Technical was the only seat on this shape when ranking
        first shipped. This extends it to the other four — news, macro,
        earnings, smart_money — each via its own `to_verdict()` (or, for
        news, the module-level `news_verdict_for_symbol`, since News files
        several items per symbol with no single object to call it on).

        Two of the four arrive in a DIFFERENT shape here than their own
        agent modules use: `macro_analysis` and each `earnings_analyses`
        entry's `"analysis"` key are plain dicts (already `model_dump()`'d
        for the pipeline), not live `MacroAnalysis`/`EarningsAnalysis`
        objects — re-parsed via `model_validate` before `to_verdict()` can
        be called. `smart_money_findings` and `news_intel` are already the
        real objects.

        Every per-seat, per-symbol step is wrapped: a single malformed dict,
        an `EarningsAnalysis` whose disclosed bull/bear case is the literal
        "not disclosed" placeholder (which `to_verdict()` deliberately
        refuses to construct from — see that method), or any other
        unexpected shape must drop ONLY that one seat's contribution for
        that one symbol, never the whole ranking. Mirrors the
        never-block-the-run posture already established by
        `_record_seat_stances` and `_check_levels_coverage`.

        **2026-09-13, retired item 31 — macro is now sector-adjusted.**
        It used to be applied via its plain `equity_outlook`, the same for
        every symbol, while `build_evidence_registry` — the same macro read,
        rendered into the same prompt — already resolved a per-symbol stance
        from `sector_guidance`. The two could and did disagree for any symbol
        whose sector view differed from the broad market view: one belief,
        two answers, in one prompt.

        `symbol_sectors` (the same mapping `build_evidence_registry` takes,
        from the same run-scoped `ctx.symbol_sectors` map) is now passed
        per symbol into `MacroAnalysis.to_verdict`, which resolves the sector
        stance through the identical `collapse_stances` reduction the
        registry uses and falls back to `equity_outlook` when the read stated
        nothing for that sector. See that method for why the old objection
        ("nothing sector-specific to attach") only held for conviction, and
        what is done about it.

        Sectors arrive keyed however the caller had them; matching is
        case-insensitive on the symbol, so a lower-case key still resolves.
        A symbol absent from the mapping simply gets the broad read, exactly
        as before — this can only ever make a verdict agree with the
        registry, never introduce a stance neither of them held.

        A NEW governance overlay on top of `candidate_eligibility`'s R2-R6
        pre-decision gates: the ROLE-BASED conviction bar
        (`own_bar_block_reason`). A name is admitted only if the technical seat
        confirms timing (a timing VETO, no positive weight), NO seat is opposed,
        and at least one NON-technical seat took a supported directional side
        (`_has_supported_directional_thesis` — not a genuine specificity or
        falsifiability test; News and Smart-money always synthesise their
        invalidation). Deliberately OUTSIDE
        `candidate_eligibility` so the audit shadow
        (`ops/model_policy/deterministic_selection.py`) keeps mirroring those
        gates exactly.

        ENTRY vs STAY — two verdicts from ONE bar (owner ruling 2026-09-25):

          * ENTRY (a candidate NOT in `held_symbols`): full-strict. Any R7
            failure — technical veto, opposition, OR a soft miss (no supported
            directional thesis) — moves the name OUT of `ranked` and INTO
            `blocked` under `CONVICTION_BAR_REASON_PREFIX`. Unchanged.
          * STAY (a candidate IN `held_symbols`): OPPOSITION-ONLY. A held name
            is culled into `blocked` (which rotation's `ineligible_hold` tier
            reads) ONLY when a seat is ACTIVELY OPPOSED to the held direction
            (`own_bar_opposition_reason` non-None). A held name that fails the
            entry bar on SOFT grounds — no technical read this review, a
            neutral/non-confirming technical read, or support that faded to
            neutral — is dropped from the ranked survivors (it does not belong
            in the fresh-entry budget order) but gets NO cull reason: it earns
            its right to STAY. The price-thesis-break exit
            (`src.risk.exit_guard`) handles genuine deterioration separately.

        Supportive/opposed are read from the SEAT VERDICTS
        (`AnalystVerdict`), one source of "which seat took which side" — a long
        is supported by a bullish verdict, a short by a bearish one — so this
        never introduces a second notion of "aligned".

        SAFETY INVARIANT this relies on (not enforced by the type system): every
        symbol in `ranked` is expected to already carry a technical verdict in
        `by_symbol`, because ranking itself is derived from technical reads (see
        `_render_candidate_ranking`: "no Technical reads this session -> nothing
        to rank"). So the "absent technical read" branch is expected to never
        fire for a real ranked name — a ranked name with no technical verdict at
        all would mean that upstream invariant broke. It is logged loudly below
        when it does; the name is still handled safely (an entry candidate is
        refused, a held name drops from survivors without a spurious cull).
