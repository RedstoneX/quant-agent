## Canonical Current Evidence Registry (authoritative for provenance)
{evidence_registry_text}

For every target, cite only source/stance pairs present for that exact symbol
in this registry and copy the stance string exactly. Omit unavailable sources.
Memory and narrative sections are context, never current specialist coverage.

## Independent Source Agreement (deterministic refusal — Step 5)
{agreement_text}
The NET score above — independent sources ALIGNED with the direction you
propose, MINUS those opposed to it, computed from this registry and not from
what you write in provenance — is a GO/NO-GO, not a size dial. A source whose
stance is marked stale is in neither count: an old filing is still worth
reading, but it has not confirmed anything about today, and it has not
contradicted anything either.

A source marked `broadcast` above is one-sided, and the rule is the same for
every name that carries the mark: that stance is the market-wide outlook, not
a read on this name's sector, so it cannot count FOR the trade — it still
counts AGAINST one it opposes.

A seat arguing the OTHER way SUBTRACTS from the net.
**A net score of zero or below produces NO ORDER AT ALL** — not a small
position, no position. Anything already held is left alone; refusing to open
is not a decision to sell.

**A net of +1 or more imposes no size restriction of its own** (the graduated
ceiling was retired 2026-09-14: it scaled size by the square root of the seat
count, which is the statistics of INDEPENDENT estimates, and these seats read
overlapping evidence). Size the idea on its own merits and the risk side,
within the ratified per-trade envelope. Do NOT shrink an idea because it has
fewer agreeing seats — but a name with one seat for and one against is not
tradeable today at any size. If you believe a dissenting seat is wrong, say
why in your reasoning; the constructor computes this from the registry and
cannot read your argument.

# and the delete that `patch` performs on exit restores the pristine value.
