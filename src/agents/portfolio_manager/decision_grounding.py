    # --- The sub-floor catalyst gate (2026-09-02) -------------------------
    #
    # WHAT WENT WRONG. The prompt sets a reward:risk floor and permits a
    # below-floor pick that names a catalyst. Benchmarked 2026-09-01 on the
    # real opportunity set of the zero-trade day (`run-64290730`), both
    # candidate models picked NVDA at R/R 1.03 in 9 of 9 runs and passed over
    # GEV, which cleared the floor. THE MODELS DID NOT DISOBEY: every
    # sub-floor pick named a catalyst, cut size, and said in plain text that
    # the ratio was below floor. The rule-compliance grader passed them and
    # the risk manager agreed.
    #
    # The hole is in the RULE. For any mega-cap the news feed always carries
    # a concrete catalyst, so an assertable exception is a null constraint on
    # exactly the names it most needs to bind. Worse, the desk's own
    # `active_state_changes` block fed the PM two HIGH-conviction bullish
    # NVDA items that morning, which became the catalyst justifying the
    # exception — the accountability machinery supplying the key to its own
    # lock. The live run's recorded NVDA catalyst was a $3B SB Energy
    # investment that appears in NO state-change row at all.
    #
    # So this is a code problem, not a model problem, and a tenth firmly
    # worded sentence in a 52KB prompt whose ninth was obeyed is not a
    # design. Two deterministic changes, both AFTER the PM submits:
    #   1. the catalyst must RESOLVE to a specific `active_state_changes`
    #      row (this table already carries dates and symbols), or the
    #      exception does not apply and the target is dropped;
    #   2. a sub-floor pick that does resolve is capped at the smallest
    #      starter size the desk can hold.
    # Costs nothing when the catalyst is real; costs the slot when it is
    # decorative.

        The block the PM is shown is built by
        `TradingPipeline._build_active_state_changes`, which is the only
        producer of this format, so parsing its own output back is a
        round-trip over a format this repo owns end to end — not an attempt
        to read arbitrary prose. A line that does not match is skipped
        rather than raising: an unparseable row must narrow what can be
        cited, never fail the session.

        DIRECTION. Each symbol is rendered as `SYMBOL(direction)` (Phase 13
        catalyst-gate fix — see `StateChange.symbol_direction` in
        src/models.py). A symbol rendered without a recognized
        `(bullish|bearish|neutral)` suffix — including the `(unknown)` the
        producer writes for a symbol with no recorded direction — is still
        recorded (so the "row exists and names this symbol" fact is not
        lost) but with an empty direction set, which cannot satisfy
        `_catalyst_cites_state_change`'s directional check. Fail closed:
        an undirected mention proves the row exists, not that it agrees
        with the trade.

        Rows sharing a date are UNIONED per symbol (a symbol's direction
        set can pick up entries from more than one same-day row). A
        citation therefore proves "a HIGH-conviction state change affecting
        this symbol in THIS direction was recorded on this date", which is
        the checkable claim; it does not distinguish two same-day rows
        about the same name, and it does not need to.

        RECENCY. A row older than `ACTIVE_STATE_CHANGE_WINDOW_DAYS`, or dated
        in the future, is dropped. This is redundant TODAY — the producer
        scans exactly that window, so it cannot render an older row — and it
        is here so it stays true: the age bound is currently a property of
        one function in `pipeline.py`, and if that ever drifts, the thing
        that silently widens is what counts as a catalyst. It reuses the
        producer's own constant rather than choosing a second number.
        `asof` defaults to the trading calendar's today; if that cannot be
        read the error propagates, so the session fails loudly instead of
        quietly switching off the news-reason checks.
