        38 of the 65 analysed filings came back `sentiment: neutral`. A
        neutral earnings sentiment is not a quiet bearish read — it is the
        seat declining to conclude, and `EarningsAnalysis.to_verdict()`

        analyst". Those 38 blocks were 16,885 of the prompt's 100,968
        characters — 16.7% of everything the decision seat reads, saying
        nothing it can act on.

        WHAT THE CUT IS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A TRUNCATION LIMIT. There is no

        every filing on a given day carries a call, this roll-up is empty
        and nothing is shortened.

        WHAT SURVIVES. Every rolled-up symbol is still named, on its own
        line, with its form, its filing date, its conviction, its cache
        provenance and its staleness marker — so coverage is never
        silently absent and a reader can always tell "read, no call" from
        "never read". The stance itself continues to reach the PM through
        the Canonical Evidence Registry and the Independent Source

        §9.4 pays for agreement, and before this gate it paid the same for a
        view formed yesterday and one formed six months ago: the registry
        recorded only `investment_implications.sentiment` and dropped
        `filing_date` and `is_new` on the floor, so a cached bullish earnings
        stance was a full live corroborating source forever. Nothing in
        `src/risk/rules.py` or `src/portfolio_constructor.py` looked at age.
        That was reachable, not theoretical: when a symbol has no filing
        inside the provider's 45-day SEC scan window,
        `EarningsProvider._check_symbol` fell back to
        `_get_existing_analysis`, which re-served whatever was on disk with
        no age bound of its own (the store prunes at 1000 days).
        `_get_existing_analysis` now carries this same bound (2026-09-02,
        same constant, `src/data/earnings.py`), so that specific route to a
        stale stance is closed at the source — an over-age analysis is no
        longer handed to a session at all. This gate stays regardless: it is
        what actually governs the TALLY for a stance from ANY source, so a
        stale view that reaches the registry some other way is still caught
        here rather than relying on every producer to self-police age.

        earnings seat's own prompt and the missed-opportunity scan already
        use. See that constant for why it is reused rather than invented.

        A stale stance is REMOVED FROM THE TALLY ONLY. It stays in the
        canonical registry, so `validate_grounding` still recognises the
        coverage and a PM that cites it does not fail the session — this is
        a size reduction, not a new hard block. The prompt marks it so the
        PM cannot read it as corroborating.

        An absent or unparseable `filing_date` is treated as stale: an
        unknowable age is not evidence of freshness, and the same call is

        a ONE-SIDED removal: a broadcast stance may not CORROBORATE a trade,
        and its dissent still counts against one. NOT `ignored_sources`, the
        two-sided freshness removal — see "why one-sided" below, which is the
        load-bearing part of this docstring.

        Board item 109, owner ruling 2026-09-25. Macro is the only seat that
        back-fills a stance onto every name: when this read stated nothing
        about a symbol's sector, `build_evidence_registry` writes the broad
        `equity_outlook` into that symbol's registry slot. The §9.4 tally
        then reads it as one more INDEPENDENT per-name seat, so a single
        market-wide opinion is counted once per name — the same one data
        point, re-used as though several analysts had each looked at each
        name. That is the double count this removes.

        Macro is NOT removed and NOT muted. A SECTOR-SPECIFIC macro stance
        counts in the tally exactly as before, and a broadcast stance still
        reaches the candidate RANKING through the seat's own stated
        `confidence` (`MacroAnalysis.to_verdict` ->
        `src/verdicts.py::score_verdict`, at `SEAT_WEIGHT["macro"]`). Only
        its claim to be per-NAME agreement goes.

        **WHY ONE-SIDED, and why the first attempt at this was wrong.** The
        first version of this gate took the broadcast stance off BOTH counts,
        reasoning that a symmetric removal was what "sign-symmetric" meant.
        It is not, and it LOOSENED the entry gate — the exact opposite of
        what a double-count fix must do. Worked example, executed: technical
        bullish, earnings bullish, news bearish, macro broadcast bearish is
        2 aligned / 2 opposed, net 0, which `agreement_refuses_trade`
        REFUSES; drop the macro dissent and it is 2 aligned / 1 opposed,
        net +1, and the desk buys it. Nobody sanctioned that, and three
        comments in the same change still claimed gating a stance "can only
        ever shrink" the net while it no longer could.

        The owner's sign-symmetry ruling does not decide this, and saying it
        does is how the error got in. "It can be measured and weighted
        depending on if it's positive or negative. Would help on a long or a
        short" is symmetry between the two SIDES OF A TRADE — a long and a
        short must be treated alike. A one-sided removal satisfies that
        exactly: flip the reading's sign and flip the trade's direction and
        the answer is unchanged (broadcast-bullish on a short and
        broadcast-bearish on a long both score -1; broadcast-bullish on a
        long and broadcast-bearish on a short both score 0). What differs is
        SUPPORT versus OPPOSITION, which is a different axis entirely and one
        he did not rule on.

        So the axis he DID rule on is the one that decides it: a market-wide
        opinion must not manufacture agreement for a name nobody examined. It
        was never an argument for silencing a warning. Declining a trade on a
        broad bearish read costs an opportunity; taking one on a broad
        bullish read costs money, and only one of those is reversible.

        **This is deliberately the OPPOSITE carve-out from
        `src/risk/rules.py::_is_broadcast_macro_verdict`, which drops a
        broadcast stance from OPPOSITION at the conviction bar.** The two
        are not inconsistent, and the difference is the blast radius, not the
        seat: there, opposition CULLS, and one `equity_outlook` flip acting
        on every held name at once is a portfolio-wide forced liquidation
        dressed up as per-name judgement (that is the documented reason the
        carve-out exists). Here, opposition merely refuses ONE new entry.
        Both gates therefore resolve a broadcast stance the same way in
        substance: it is never the reason the desk takes on risk, and never
        the reason it dumps the book, but it may be the reason it declines a
        single new name.
