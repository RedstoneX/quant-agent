"""Decision grounding: the agent HOLDS the standalone part instead of inheriting a mixin.

Bodies live in src/agents/portfolio_manager/decision_grounding.py (`DecisionGrounding`).
`hold_decision_grounding(agent_cls)` builds one part and installs same-named classmethod
delegates on the agent class, so every existing call site (`self.validate_grounding(...)`,
`PortfolioManagerAgent._canonical_targets(...)`) keeps resolving. Nothing is snapshotted:
`build_evidence_registry` is called through the agent class, `_CONFLICT_SOURCE_ALIASES`
(now a class attribute of the agent) is read at every lookup, and the three bodies the
part reads through `self.` are handed in live (see held_part.live_body). The
module-level names are re-exported unchanged for the package's patch mirror.
