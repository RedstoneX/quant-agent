    """Item 157's runtime check (2026-09-23): a strict `json_schema`
    response format is supposed to make fenced markdown around the JSON and
    undeclared keys on a row impossible. Whether it actually does, on either
    route, was meant to be confirmed by a live pytest call — but no
    deployed process ever holds a real `GOOGLE_API_KEY` for a pytest run to
    use (see docs/WORK.md item 157, tests/test_tech_schema_live.py), so
    that plan can never execute. This runs instead, on every real call,
    where the key actually is. It never changes what gets parsed or used —
    a hit here is evidence for a human deciding item 157, not a gate.

    `provider` is `AgentResult.actual_provider` for the call this answer
    came from. Only "openrouter" and "google" are ever given a
    response_format at all (see `_call_openai_wire` in src/agents/base.py);
    a bare Anthropic call, or any other fallback, was never asked to
    conform to a schema, so a fenced/extra-key hit against a call routed
    there is not evidence the schema failed — it is tagged with the
    provider precisely so nobody downstream conflates the two (adversary
    review, 2026-09-23).
