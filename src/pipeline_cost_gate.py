"""The paid-analysis gate: cost-circuit activation, preflight, status and the suspension payloads.

Moved VERBATIM out of `TradingPipeline` in `src/pipeline.py` (board: the
pipeline split). Function-only module in the `src.pipeline_sizing` shape: each
function takes the pipeline (or any stub carrying the attributes it reads) as
its first argument, so the gate can be built and exercised from stubs without
constructing a `TradingPipeline`. The bodies did not change by one character;
the parameter is still named `self` for that reason. `TradingPipeline` keeps a
one-line shim per name so every `self._x(...)` caller and every
`patch.object(TradingPipeline, "_x")` keeps working.

Attributes read off the first argument: `cost_circuit`,
`_active_cost_run_context`, the ten agent seats named in
`_attach_cost_circuit_to_agents`, and the sibling gate functions through
`self` (which the shims provide).

This module must not import `src.pipeline`.
