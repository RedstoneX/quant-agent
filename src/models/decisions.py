        """Reward/risk ratio of the CONSTRUCTED order, computed in Python.

        Deliberately mirrors `TechAnalysisResult.risk_reward` — including its
        "not trusted to the LLM" rule — because the object that ACTUALLY
        REACHES EXECUTION never got that treatment, and the omission cost a
        live trading session on 2026-08-31.

        What happened: the Risk Manager is handed entry/stop/target as bare
        text with no ratio, so it does the division inside the model. For a
        BUY on RSG (entry $221.14, stop $207.90, target $242.96) it computed
        the ratio TWICE IN ONE RESPONSE — `rr_audit` said "R/R = 1.65 ...
        above 1.5, so compliant", while `reasoning` said "R/R = 1.31, which
        is below the 1.5 floor" and rejected the trade. The pipeline acts on
        the second field. 1.65 is correct; 1.31 matches no combination of the
        inputs and was simply wrong.

        An LLM must not own the arithmetic of a gate. It judges; the
        deterministic side computes. Geometry rules match the tech-analyst
        field: prices must be present and the inequalities must hold for the
        side, else None, so nobody renders a fake ratio.

        Since 2026-09-02 the division itself lives in `reward_to_risk`, so
        this field, `TechAnalysisResult.risk_reward`, the constructor's
        entry gate and the execution-time re-check are all the SAME
        arithmetic on whatever geometry each is handed. See that function
        for the XLE 1.67-vs-1.18 rejection that forced it.
