#: `news_verdict_for_symbol`'s conviction -> `AnalystVerdict.magnitude` map.
#: Judgment call (flagged for review, Phase 13 §13.3 posture — start equal,

#: field at all, only a three-rung conviction, so unlike
#: `RATING_MAGNITUDE` (which has a true neutral rung at 0.0 to anchor

#: rungs equally across (0, 1] — never landing on 0.0, which the
#: `AnalystVerdict` validator reserves for a real neutral read — keeps "low
#: conviction" a genuine (if weak) lean instead of a silent no-lean that
#: would rank identically to a symbol nobody covered.
#: DELETED 2026-09-13 (retired item 31): `NEWS_CONVICTION_MAGNITUDE`,
#: {low 0.33, medium 0.67, high 1.0}. It was a table on `conviction` — the
#: same field this verdict already reports as `conviction` — so
#: `score_verdict`'s two-signal composite counted news's conviction twice, at
#: a spacing nothing stood behind. Magnitude is now `NO_STATED_STRENGTH`
#: (0.0 — this seat has no strength scale of its own and does not borrow
#: Technical's); the conviction it was derived from is unchanged and still
#: carried, and is what reaches the ranking.

#: Same ordinal `_CONVICTION_RANK` idea as `src/nominations.py` and
#: `CONVICTION_SCORE` in `src/verdicts.py` (low < medium < high), kept as a

def news_verdict_for_symbol(symbol: str, items: list["StockNewsItem"]) -> "AnalystVerdict":
    """Collapse every `StockNewsItem` the News seat filed for one symbol
    into the one `AnalystVerdict` the Portfolio Manager compares seats by.

    Precondition: `items` is the list filed under one `stock_news` key.
    An empty list is the uncovered marker (`analyze()` fills `[]` for a
    shown symbol the seat omitted, and the model may emit `[]` for an
    incidental mention). Callers that build ranking verdicts skip empty
    lists so UNKNOWN is not collapsed into a fake neutral lean; this
    function itself fails soft (neutral, no lean) rather than raising.

    **direction** — the collapsed sentiment across every item, via
    `src.quantities.collapse_stances` — the SAME reduction
    `PortfolioManagerAgent.build_evidence_registry` already applies to
    `(i.sentiment for i in items)` (see `PortfolioManagerAgent.
    _collapse_stances`, now a thin wrapper over the same function). Reusing
    it rather than inventing a second disagreement rule is deliberate: a
    verdict and a registry stance about the same symbol must never resolve
    a three-way sentiment split differently. `collapse_stances` returns
    "mixed" for any unresolved disagreement (including a directional
    sentiment sitting alongside a "neutral" one) — that is treated as
    neutral here, same as an empty `items` list: an unresolved split is the
    absence of a call, not a third direction `AnalystVerdict` has no room
    for.

    **conviction** — JUDGMENT CALL, flagged for review. `collapse_stances`
    decides the winning DIRECTION but says nothing about conviction, so:
    among the items whose own `sentiment` agrees with the final collapsed
    direction, take the HIGHEST conviction. Rationale: an item that
    disagreed with the eventual call was outvoted and its confidence in the
    losing side is not evidence for how strongly to hold the winning one;
    among the items that agree, the most confident one is the strongest
    stated support the desk actually has for this call. A neutral verdict
    (collapse resolved to neutral, or resolved to "mixed", or `items` was
    empty) has no winning side to draw a conviction from, so it defaults to
    "low" — the weakest assertion the scale offers, since there is
    nothing here to be confident ABOUT.

    **magnitude** — `NO_STATED_STRENGTH` (None), directional or not. A news
    item states a sentiment and a conviction, and nothing else about how far
    it leans: a magnitude derived from that conviction would be the same
    signal counted twice in `score_verdict`, and a magnitude borrowed off
    Technical's rungs would be a scale this seat does not have. The seat
    still reaches the ranking through its weighted conviction. See
    `NO_STATED_STRENGTH` for the full reasoning and what was deleted.

    **evidence** — one `VerdictEvidence(label="headline", text=...)` per
    item, `headline` and `impact_summary` joined so the check is visible
    without opening the source article, capped at `_MAX_NEWS_EVIDENCE_ITEMS`
    (JUDGMENT CALL, flagged for review) so a symbol with a long news day
    does not bloat the verdict — earlier items are kept (arrival order,
    unchanged from `NewsIntelligenceReport.stock_news`), on the assumption
    that News files its most decision-relevant item first. Included even
    for a neutral verdict (optional there, but still useful context).

    **invalidation** — JUDGMENT CALL, flagged for review. News items carry
    no stated falsifier the way `TechAnalysisResult.thesis_invalid_if` does,
    but `AnalystVerdict` refuses a directional (non-neutral) verdict with a
    blank one, so something honest has to be constructed.

    The obvious candidate — quote whichever item disagreed with the final
    direction as "the stated case against the call" — turns out to be
    unreachable given `StockNewsItem.sentiment`'s domain (bullish/bearish/
    neutral only): `collapse_stances` only resolves to a directional
    (non-"mixed") result when EVERY surviving sentiment is that exact same
    value (its `len(cleaned) == 1` branch — the positive/negative-SET
    branches below it can never fire for a 3-valued domain where each
    polarity set has exactly one reachable member). So whenever this
    function's `direction` is bullish or bearish, by construction every
    item already agrees with it and there is no opposing item to quote.
    (Proven in `tests/test_news_verdict.py::
    test_a_directional_call_never_has_a_disagreeing_item_to_quote`.)

    So the only honest falsifier available is structural: a later headline
    reporting the opposite sentiment on this symbol. That is a generic,
    templated sentence, not a fabricated specific fact, and it is the same
    sentence for every directional call — flagged so review can judge
    whether that bar is met, or whether "" (like the neutral case) would be
    more honest than a templated non-fact.

    A neutral verdict states no invalidation ("") — a neutral read is the
    absence of a call, so `AnalystVerdict` does not require one and none is
    invented.
