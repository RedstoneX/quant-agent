                       purchase cluster (`InsiderPurchaseCluster`) is lifted
                       from "medium" to "high". Nothing else moves: "low"
                       stays low, "high" cannot go higher, a bearish or
                       neutral read is untouched, and the model has no say —
                       it may mention the cluster, the code sets the rung.

        evidence     — `summary` and `why_now`, each as one labelled item

                       For a directional verdict the base model REQUIRES a

                       `why_now`, framed as a condition: the call stands
