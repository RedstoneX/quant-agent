class SymbolRejection(LLMOutputModel):
    """One symbol refused on its own merits, without touching the rest of
    the plan. The per-TRADE lane of the risk verdict.

    Why this exists (spec Phase 10.1). `RiskVerdict.approved` is one bool
    for the whole plan, and `RiskModification` can retune a symbol's fields
    but cannot refuse one. So a single failing leg killed every other leg:
    on run `run-64290730` (2026-09-01 morning) the risk manager rejected the
    whole plan citing XLE alone — constructed R/R 1.18, under the 1.5 floor —
    and CHPX died with it at R/R 3.03, different sector, unrelated thesis.
    Zero trades.

    The governing principle, in the owner's words: *"The batch is arbitrary —
    it is whatever happened to be proposed in one run. Judging a trade against
    its accidental co-passengers makes no sense. Judge it against what the
    account actually holds."* A per-SYMBOL failure (an R/R breach on one name,
    an event-risk flag on one name) refuses that name and nothing else. A
    BOOK-level failure (a correlation cluster, total exposure, drawdown state)
    is a property of the whole account and still refuses everything, via
    `approved=false` — see the field comment on `RiskVerdict.rejected_symbols`.

    `reason` is not optional prose: it is the per-symbol audit trail, written
    to `specialist_evidence` (kind=`rejection`, scope=`symbol`) and to the
    symbol's `pipeline_event`, so "why was this name refused" is answerable
    per name rather than only per run.

        a missing/blank `reason` on an otherwise well-formed entry becomes
        the same. An entry naming NO recoverable symbol is deliberately left
        to fail validation: the verdict then fails closed as a whole (see
