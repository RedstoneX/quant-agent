        A RESTATEMENT, not a second opinion, mirroring
        `TechAnalysisResult.to_verdict` — see that method for the pattern
        this follows.

        `MacroAnalysis` is market-wide, not per-symbol (no `symbol` field
        on this model — see the evidence-registry seat-name comment
        threaded through `PortfolioManagerAgent.build_evidence_registry`,
        which already applies one macro read to many symbols). The caller
        supplies which symbol this verdict is being cast for, and — as of
        2026-09-13 — which SECTOR that symbol belongs to.

        direction    — `sector`'s own stance from `sector_guidance` when this
                       read stated one for it; otherwise `equity_outlook`.

                       **2026-09-13, retired item 31.** This used to be
                       `equity_outlook` for every symbol, while
                       `build_evidence_registry` — the SAME macro read, in
                       the same prompt — already resolved a per-symbol stance
                       from `sector_guidance` and only fell back to the broad
                       outlook when the sector had no row. So the desk could
                       tell the PM "macro is bearish energy" in the evidence
                       registry and simultaneously rank an energy name on a
                       bullish broad read. One belief, two answers.

                       The resolution here is deliberately the registry's
                       own, not a second rule: the matching rows' stances go
                       through the identical `collapse_stances` reduction
                       (`src/quantities.py`, the one definition both call),
                       and the result is translated tilt -> direction by
                       `normalize_sector_stance` — the module-level map that
                       exists precisely so overweight/underweight is not
                       respelled per consumer. An unresolved split across
                       rows ("mixed") normalizes to None and is treated as
                       NEUTRAL, matching the registry, where "mixed" fails
                       `stance_is_aligned` and supports nothing. Nothing is
                       invented and no number is introduced.

                       The objection this method used to record — that
                       `MacroAnalysis` "carries one conviction/evidence/
                       invalidation set for its whole read, so there is
                       nothing sector-specific to attach" — is only half
                       true, and the true half does not block this. Evidence
                       IS sector-specific: the matching row's own `reason`,
                       already on the model, is surfaced first and labelled
                       as the stance that decided the direction. Conviction
                       is not, so `confidence` is still used unchanged — it
                       is the only confidence this seat states, it is what
                       the broad read used too, and substituting a
                       sector-specific one would mean inventing it.
        conviction   — `confidence` verbatim; already high/medium/low.
        magnitude    — `NO_STATED_STRENGTH` (None), directional or not. See
                       that constant for why the previous confidence-keyed
                       table and regime-shift bonus were deleted rather than
                       re-derived, and why nothing was borrowed in their
                       place. `regime_shift` in particular changes nothing
                       here — `AnalystVerdict` refuses a neutral verdict with
                       nonzero magnitude anyway, and a "neutral, but
                       shifting" read is a contradiction in terms this
                       method does not try to resolve silently. This seat
                       reaches the ranking through its weighted conviction.
        evidence     — the deciding `sector_guidance` row first when a sector
                       stance was applied (labelled `sector_stance:<sector>`,
                       so a reader can see WHY this symbol's direction
                       differs from the broad one), then `key_observations`
                       (indicator/reading/interpretation, one VerdictEvidence
                       each), the full `sector_guidance` list (sector +
                       stance + reason), and `risk_factors` (one per item).
                       All qualitative (`text=`); MacroAnalysis carries no
                       evidence-shaped numbers to attach as `value=`.
        invalidation — `shift_reason` when `regime_shift` is True and the
                       reason is non-empty: the stated condition already IS
                       the falsifier for a regime call. Otherwise, mirroring
                       Technical's "fall back to the analyst's own stated
                       falsifier" pattern: for a bullish call, the first
                       `bear_triggers` entry (what would prove it wrong); for
                       a bearish call, the first `bull_triggers` entry.
                       UNLIKE Technical, when direction is not neutral and
                       none of the above is available (no shift_reason, no
                       trigger on the falsifying side), a generic fallback
                       string is used rather than leaving this blank —
                       `AnalystVerdict` REQUIRES a non-empty invalidation for
                       any non-neutral call (see its
                       `_a_call_must_be_falsifiable_and_backed` validator) and
                       raises `ValidationError` otherwise, so an empty string
                       is only ever valid here for a neutral outlook.
