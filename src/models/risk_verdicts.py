    """The risk seat's chain on the EXIT-REVIEW path.

    Same six steps as `RiskReasoningChain`, but three of them are no longer
    MANDATORY, because the exit prompt itself already tells the seat they do
    not apply here (`src/agents/risk_review_mode._EXIT_REVIEW_HEADER`), and a
    `min_length=1` field is a demand for an answer:

    - `rr_audit` — checklist 2 is stood down. An exit has no entry geometry:
      `_risk_review_exits` sends entry, stop and target as `0.0` because there
      is no such thing to send. There is no ratio to audit.
    - `sizing_sanity` — checklist 5 is stood down. No BUY or SHORT reaches
      this path, and the % on an exit is the position reviewer's call on its
      own position.
    - `event_risk` — checklist 4 INVERTS here. "A binary event inside the
      window, so downsize or reject" was written for an ENTRY, where refusing
      carries LESS risk through the event. On an exit, refusing carries the
      position THROUGH it. Compelling an answer to a question whose standing
      instruction points the wrong way is not a safeguard; it produced the one
      measured harm on this path. Archived row 330 (2026-09-01, `close-`
      `0e9129f1`) answered "next earnings dates were NOT FETCHED this run" and
      then set `reason_category: "data_degraded"` on that basis — a label
      `portfolio_manager` reads back to self-calibrate. Optional here means
      the seat may still report the dates it was given; it is no longer forced
      to manufacture a paragraph about them.

    `signal_fidelity`, `correlation_check` and `overall` stay mandatory: all
    three are live questions on an exit, and `overall` is the audit trail.

    Nothing here touches the morning BUY path — `RiskReasoningChain` is
    unchanged and all six of its fields remain mandatory.
