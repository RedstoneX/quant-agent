    Phase 9 (`docs/QAMC_REMEDIATION_SPEC.md` §9.1/§9.2): before this,
    Technical was the ONLY seat that could originate a trade idea — every
    other seat could only rate a symbol Technical had already picked. A
    nomination inverts that: any seat can ask the desk to look at a
    symbol, and an on-demand Technical call decides whether there is an
    actual tradeable setup.

    This is deliberately NOT a trade recommendation. It carries the
    minimum a responder pass needs to act on it: which symbol, how
    strongly the nominating seat feels, and the concrete observation
    behind the ask — a nomination with no stated reason is not a
    nomination, hence `observation` is required non-empty.

    `seat` is stamped by the pipeline when a report's nominations are
    collected (`src/pipeline_stages.py::_collect_seat_nominations`), not

    internal name, only that it may nominate. It defaults to "" so a

    """The one shape every specialist seat hands the Portfolio Manager.

    Phase 13 (`docs/QAMC_REMEDIATION_SPEC.md` §13.2): the PM was comparing
    several different essays and picking one. This is the checkable,
    comparable judgement instead — the same four things from every seat:

    1. **direction** — bullish / bearish / neutral, PLUS `magnitude`, how
       far in that direction the seat leans on a 0..1 scale — or `None`,
       meaning this seat HAS no strength scale and states none. The label
       vocabulary is the one `stance_is_aligned` and the evidence registry
       already speak (`StockNewsItem.sentiment`, `SmartMoneyFinding.stance`,
       `MacroAnalysis.equity_outlook`), so a verdict can be netted against
       the §9.4 score without a translation table.

       **`None` is not zero — item 65, 2026-09-26.** Until this date a seat
       with no strength scale sent the literal `0.0`, which is a STATED
       strength of nothing and is indistinguishable, at every consumer, from
       a seat that has a scale and read zero off it. The ranking then summed
       four such terms into a number it labelled "strength, summed over N
       seats" and showed the Portfolio Manager. A sum is additively neutral
       to a zero, so the ORDER was never wrong — but the reported quantity
       was, and nothing structural stopped a future consumer from averaging,
       min-ing or thresholding those zeros, at which point the placeholder
       would have moved money. `None` makes the absence a type rather than a
       value: it cannot be summed by accident, and every consumer has to say
       what it does with a seat that has no scale.
    2. **conviction** — how sure the seat is, on the desk's existing
       `high` / `medium` / `low` scale, SEPARATE from what it thinks.
    3. **evidence** — a list of `VerdictEvidence`, at least one for any
       directional call. A neutral read may carry none.
    4. **invalidation** — the stated condition under which the call is
       wrong. Required non-empty for any directional call. A neutral verdict
       is the ABSENCE of a call, so there is nothing to falsify and the field
       may be blank; a neutral verdict with a non-zero magnitude is refused
       as self-contradictory.

    `seat` and `symbol` are identity, not judgement. `seat` uses the
    evidence-registry key for the seat ("technical", "news", ...) so a
    verdict and a registry stance about the same name agree on who said it.

    `signed_magnitude` is the number a ranking or a netting rule reads:
    +magnitude for bullish, -magnitude for bearish, 0 for neutral — and
    `None` when the seat stated no strength at all, for the same reason
    `magnitude` is `None`: an absent number must not arrive as a zero.

    Not an `LLMOutputModel` — see `VerdictEvidence` for why.

#: How a Technical rating maps onto `AnalystVerdict.magnitude`. The rating
#: scale has exactly two directional rungs a side (buy / strong_buy), so this
#: is an EQUAL-SPACING ordinal encoding of the desk's own scale. It is not a
#: measured weight: `score_verdict` adds it to the independent conviction
#: score, making the chosen spacing load-bearing. Item 90's settlement route
#: is structural reformulation, not fitting these values to desk outcomes.
RATING_MAGNITUDE: dict[str, float] = {
    "strong_buy": 1.0, "buy": 0.5, "neutral": 0.0, "sell": 0.5, "strong_sell": 1.0,

#: `AnalystVerdict.magnitude` for a DIRECTIONAL verdict from a seat that
#: states no independent strength of its own. It is `None` — the ABSENCE of
#: a number, not a number — so there is nothing here for an arithmetic to
#: consume by accident.
#:
#: WHY THIS IS FLAT, 2026-09-13 (see `docs/INCIDENT_HISTORY.md`, retired
#: item 31). `score_verdict`
#: (`src/verdicts.py`) is `magnitude + conviction_score(conviction)` — TWO
#: signals, weight 1 each. Three seats used to derive `magnitude` from the
#: very field they also hand to `conviction`:
#:
#:   * news       — magnitude was a table on `conviction` itself;
#:   * macro      — magnitude was a table on `confidence`, which IS the
#:                  conviction it reports;
#:   * smart_money— magnitude AND conviction were both tables on the single
#:                  `economic_role` label.
#:
#: For those seats the composite was not two signals averaged, it was one
#: signal counted twice, at a spacing (0.33/0.67/1.0 for news, 0.25/0.5/0.75
#: for macro, 1.0/0.6/0.3 for smart_money) that no source and no measurement
#: stood behind — three different unsourced encodings of the same 3-rung
#: scale. A "actionable" smart-money label alone scored 2.0, the maximum the
#: composite can produce, equal to a strong_buy at high conviction from the
#: one seat that was measured (item 18) as actually concluding.
#:
#: The rule now: magnitude carries information ONLY where a seat states a
#: strength independent of its confidence. Technical does (its rating rungs).
#: Nothing else on this desk does, so nothing else claims one. This REMOVES
#: invented numbers rather than replacing them with better-argued ones —
#: `qamc-no-arbitrary-numbers-principle`. The dropped inputs are not lost to
#: the reader: macro's `regime_shift`/`shift_reason` still reach the verdict
#: as evidence and invalidation, and smart_money's `economic_role` still sets
#: conviction via `_SMART_MONEY_ROLE_CONVICTION`, whose ordering is a
#: restatement of the pre-existing `_ROLE_RANK`, not a new judgment.
#:
#: AND WHY IT IS NOT 0.5 — corrected 2026-09-13, same day, on
#: adversarial review before merge. The first version of this deletion set the
#: four rungless seats to 0.5, "Technical's `buy` rung, reused rather than
#: respelled". Borrowing is not deriving: 0.5 is a number read off ANOTHER
#: seat's scale, and these four seats do not have that scale — that is the
#: whole reason they are here. A seat that states no strength states no
#: strength, and the honest encoding of "no distance claimed" is no distance.
#:
#: AND WHY IT IS NO LONGER `0.0` EITHER — item 65, RESOLVED 2026-09-26.
#: 2026-09-13 got the judgement right and the encoding wrong. `0.0` is a
#: point ON the 0..1 strength scale, so "this seat has no scale" was being
#: spelled with a value drawn from the scale it is denying having. Verified
#: against the code before changing anything: `rank_verdicts` SUMS the term
#: (`magnitude = sum(v.magnitude * w ...)`), a zero is additively neutral,
#: and no consumer averaged or thresholded it — so the placeholder never
#: reordered a candidate and no money moved because of it. What it did do
#: was make the ranking REPORT a "strength summed over N seats" that only
#: one seat could ever contribute to, and leave the next consumer free to
#: treat four placeholders as four measured zeros. `None` is the absence
#: itself: it cannot be summed by accident, `rank_verdicts` now names the
#: seats the strength term actually covers, and a directional verdict that
#: arrives with a literal `0.0` is REFUSED by `AnalystVerdict`'s validator.
#:
#: This is only coherent because `rank_verdicts` no longer AVERAGES seats (see
#: `src/verdicts.py`): such a seat still contributes its own weighted
#: conviction to the total, so a directional read with nothing behind it is
#: not silently equal to no coverage at all — it is equal to exactly what it
#: is worth, its conviction. Under the old weighted average an absent
#: strength would have DRAGGED an agreeing candidate down; under a sum over
#: only the seats that state one, it cannot.
#:
#: THE STANDING DECISION (item 65, recorded 2026-09-26, retired with it):
#: direction plus confidence is all these four seats can say, and that is the
#: answer, not a gap awaiting a number. Each was re-checked against its own
#: model on the day: `EarningsAnalysis.investment_implications.sentiment`,
#: `StockNewsItem.sentiment`, `MacroAnalysis.equity_outlook` and
#: `SmartMoneyFinding.stance` are every one of them a SINGLE directional rung
#: (bullish/bearish/neutral) with no graded vocabulary anywhere beside them —
#: unlike Technical, whose `strong_buy`/`buy` rungs are a strength the seat
#: already publishes and `RATING_MAGNITUDE` merely transcribes. Asking any of
#: the four to emit a 0..1 number would be asking it to invent boundaries no
#: source, no measurement and no instrument supplies
#: (`qamc-no-arbitrary-numbers-principle`), and it would be uncheckable by
#: construction. REVISIT ONLY IF one of two things happens: a seat's own
#: output model gains a graded rung it genuinely observes (the way Technical
#: has one), or the conviction ledger clears `_CONVICTION_OUTCOME_MIN_N`
#: resolved calls for that seat and supplies a measured one. Either is a
#: schema change to RATIFY with the derivation attached, plus the seat's
#: prompt in the same pass — never a constant restored here.
