"""Candidate-accounting and heal records (split out of src/pipeline_stages.py).

Moved VERBATIM out of `src/pipeline_stages.py`, following the pattern of
`src/pipeline_seat_evidence.py`: the execution-skip row, the
typed pipeline-event row, and the portfolio
manager's candidate accounting (the mechanical heal, its ONE paid re-ask under
the per-seat cap, the per-symbol reason rows and the never-fatal heal record).
Every function takes the pipeline and run context as plain arguments and
reads each collaborator off that handed-in host per call, so each can be
exercised with stand-ins and no `TradingPipeline` is ever built here
(`tests/test_boundary_pipeline_candidate_records.py` is the clause-5
witness). Every moved name is re-exported from `src.pipeline_stages` through
its one lazy re-export table, so each original import path and each test
patch target is unchanged; the write-through mirror on that module keeps a
patched name the same object on both sides.

The shared names below are imported FROM `src.pipeline_stages` as the stage
modules do; `src.pipeline_stages` imports this module only lazily, by name,
so the graph stays acyclic. Not in `src.number_sources.SCOPED_PATHS`: the
block carries no ledgered number site. This module must not import
`src.pipeline` and never reaches the broker seam. `_record_scale_in_window_closed`
stays behind in `src.pipeline_stages` on purpose: its body imports the broker
seam, which the import-layering guard refuses in a part.
