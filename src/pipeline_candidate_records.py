"""Candidate accounting records (split out of src/pipeline_stages.py).

Moved VERBATIM: the durable record of what happened to each portfolio-manager
candidate (the accounting re-ask and its outcome rows), the execution-skip and
scale-in-window rows, and the pipeline event row. Every function takes the
pipeline and run context as plain arguments, so each can be exercised with
stand-ins and no `TradingPipeline` is built
(`tests/test_boundary_pipeline_candidate_records.py` is the witness).
Every name is re-exported from `src.pipeline_stages` through its one lazy table.
The soft-exit heal records live in `src/pipeline_soft_exit_records.py`.

This module must not import `src.pipeline`.
