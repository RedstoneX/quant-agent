"""The ex-dividend stop shift and the stop-coverage repair, lifted verbatim out of
`src/pipeline_protection.py` (2026-10-09, ceiling split). Behaviour is unchanged.

ONE line of `ExDividends._handle_ex_dividends` changed: `et_today()` became
`self._today()`, a keyword-only collaborator. Tests patch `src.pipeline_protection.et_today`,
and importing that module back from here would be an import cycle, so the builder there
hands in a callable that reads its own `et_today` AT CALL TIME: every such patch still
reaches this code. Built without one, the part reads the trading-calendar clock, which is
what that name resolves to when nothing patches it.
