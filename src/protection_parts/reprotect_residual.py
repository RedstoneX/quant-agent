        fresh stop on the residual qty using the most-protective price among
        the stops we cancelled to clear held_for_orders for the SELL.

        Without this, the cancel-then-sell flow introduced in P1 #3 leaves
        the residual position naked until the next morning's BUY rebuilds an
        OTO leg — which never happens for a held-through position. The stop
        we re-place isn't a perfect copy of the original (we collapse
        multiple stops onto the highest stop_price), but it preserves at
        least the most-protective coverage that was in place pre-SELL.

        ``side`` — 'sell' (default) re-places a SELL stop below price for a
        long; 'buy' re-places a BUY stop above price for a short. This also
        flips which extreme counts as "most protective": for a long's SELL
        stop, tighter/sooner-to-trigger is the HIGHEST stop_price (closest
        to price from below); for a short's BUY stop it's the OPPOSITE —
        the LOWEST stop_price (closest to price from above). Picking the
        long-side extreme for a short would silently place the loosest,
        least-protective stop of the set instead of the tightest one.

        Returns True iff a fresh stop was successfully submitted (or there
        was nothing to do). Returns False if the submit raised — drain
        callers use this to keep the persisted recovery intent alive.
        Best-effort logging: a False return doesn't propagate the
        exception (the SELL itself already succeeded), but the caller
        knows coverage wasn't actually rebuilt.

        # skip returned True — which made the drain caller delete the

        # was still owed. The distinction is made by IDENTITY, not by
        # timing and not by a tolerance: `cancelled_specs` already carry the

        # naked position is not". Nothing in this repository makes the
        # first half of that true: `src/coverage_watchdog.py` states at its
        # top that it never cancels or modifies anything, and the only
        # duplicate handling anywhere is an owner message asking for the
        # extra order to be cancelled BY HAND. Two sell stops resting over
        # one long, both elected on the same gap, sell the shares twice:
        # the second fill opens a SHORT of the position's size, which no
        # stop covers and which this desk never decided to hold. That is
