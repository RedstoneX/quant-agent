"""Board item 228 - how far each holding sits from failing each entry rule.

OWNER RULING 2026-10-02: a visibility-only heads-up of which holdings are
drifting toward the chopping block. Clears-or-fails is the sale itself; the
heads-up is the margin. This module records, once per session and per held
name, the distance to failing the rules the entry bar is made of that HAVE a
distance, in the unit each is really measured in:

  R2 rating actionable   - `r2_steps_from_neutral`: steps on the five-step
                           rating scale (strong_buy/buy/neutral/sell/
                           strong_sell). 2 = strong, 1 = plain, 0 = neutral,
                           which is the failure.
  R5 net evidence        - `r5_net_evidence`: the desk's own net independent
                           source score for the name's direction (agreeing
                           minus opposing independent sources, stale and
                           broadcast-macro stances removed exactly as
                           `candidate_eligibility` removes them). The rule
                           fails at 0 or below, so the value IS the number of
                           independent-source points above failing.
  R3 BUY-eligible, R6 constructor refusal and R7 conviction bar are
  membership tests with no distance; their failures stay in the existing
  `precheck` reasons and are not restated here.

No threshold, danger band or day count is chosen anywhere: the value is
recorded and the dashboard shows its direction of travel. NOTHING in the
trading path reads this row. It never raises, never gates and never delays: a
failed record must not take a live session with it. It is run-scoped (symbol
None) for the reason given in `_record_rotation_precheck`.
