"""Durable record of every LLM ROUTE decision: switches, half-open probes
back to the primary, and honoured Retry-After hints.

Why a journal at all. The desk's failover was previously invisible: the only
trace a route switch left was a log line, and logs are rotated and are not
queryable. The owner's question -- "how often did each route carry the desk,
and what did it cost" -- could not be answered from anything the desk kept.
Per the standing "keep what costs money" ruling, a route switch is exactly
the class of fact that must persist: it is a decision, made under stress,
that moves the desk from a free route onto a paid one.

Design constraints this module is written against:

* It must NEVER raise into the caller. A journal write failing is not a
  reason to fail a trading session's analysis -- every public function
  swallows and logs. This is the same posture ``_retry_after_hint_seconds``
  takes in ``src/agents/base.py``.
* It must not import ``src.config`` or ``src.storage``. ``src/agents/base.py``
  imports this module, and both of those import chains reach back into the
  agent layer; the cost circuit keeps the same independence for the same
  reason (see its module docstring).
* It writes into the SAME SQLite file the rest of the desk uses
  (``data/quant_agent.db``, ``storage.db_path`` in config/settings.yaml), so
  a route event can be joined against ``agent_logs`` and
  ``llm_circuit_events`` by ``run_id`` without a second database to back up.
  The path is overridable with ``QUANT_AGENT_DB_PATH`` for tests.

Cost is recorded as the PRICE OF THE ROUTE, not the price of the call: at
the moment a switch is decided no usage figures exist yet. ``agent_logs``
already carries the realised per-call cost, and the two join on ``run_id``.
