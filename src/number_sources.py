"""Fail the build when a new trade-governing number arrives with no source.

THE DEFECT. The desk's hardest standing rule (`docs/OUTCOME.md`, and the top
of `docs/WORK.md`) is that a number which governs a trade must be read off the
instrument, derived from something that is itself read off the instrument, or
carry a written derivation at its definition site. Approval does not make a
flat number non-arbitrary, and neither does backtesting it into place. On
2026-09-11 an audit listed about twenty such numbers; on 2026-09-14 every one
was re-checked and every one was still live; the finding was filed as "an
inventory, not an item / never re-audit" and nothing was assigned. A week
later they were all still live and the count had grown.

That is the real defect: **there was no mechanical check of any kind**, so
the next invented number got in for free.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES. It enumerates every numeric DEFINITION SITE inside a
declared scope, and requires each one to carry an entry in a checked-in
ledger (`config/number_ledger.yaml`) saying where the number came from. A new
number in scope with no ledger entry fails `pytest`, which is the check
branch protection requires.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, SAID FIRST BECAUSE IT IS THE HONEST FRAMING. This gate
tests that a justification EXISTS, in a shape a reader can open. It does not
and cannot test that the justification is TRUE. That distinction is not
academic: the entry this module was built around was written on shipping day,
was the most scrutinised line in the ledger, and was **false in four places**
— it claimed `min_position_risk_pct`'s 0.50% was absent from `settings.yaml`
(it is at `config/settings.yaml:751`), absent from every document (it is the
owner-ratified envelope row at `docs/OUTCOME.md:84`), absent from any
ratification record (`75c02335`, 2026-08-27), and existing in one place while
the ledger itself listed it twice. Every one of those was a one-minute grep.
So the rules below are built to make a claim CHEAP TO FALSIFY rather than to
adjudicate it: `source` must be a URL or a `file:line` a reader can open, and
`arbitrary` must carry the open question and its cost rather than being the
quiet default.

WHY A REGISTRY AND NOT AN ANNOTATION. A required comment marker (`# source:`)
was the cheaper design and was rejected: the failure this closes is that
nobody remembers the rule, and a marker is only present if somebody
remembered to type it — the check would have to accept its absence as "not a
trade number" and would therefore catch nothing. The ledger inverts that. The
scanner decides what is in scope from the code's own structure; the author
cannot opt out by staying quiet, only by writing an entry somebody reviews.

SCOPE, AND THE RULE BEHIND IT. Scope was a hand-kept file list with no stated
admission rule, which meant nothing distinguished a module that belongs from
one that does not — `src/execution/cash_sweep.py` was in and
`src/data/technical.py`, which defines the ATR period every stop multiple in
the ledger is a multiple of, was out. The rule is now written down:

  IN SCOPE: every module on the path from a seat's verdict to a broker order
  — the risk engine, the constructor, ranking, nomination, the rotation and
  cash decisions, the execution modules that price or gate an order, and the
  INDICATOR AND LEVEL modules whose outputs stops and sizes are computed
  from. A unit is in scope wherever its multiplier is.

  OUT OF SCOPE: fetching, caching, persistence, reporting, notification and
  LLM plumbing. A wrong number there degrades data or messaging, which the
  seats already see as missing evidence, and which is a different failure.

That rule is still prose, so it is backed mechanically by
`scripts/unscoped_number_guard.py`: the same scanner is run over every
`src/**.py` NOT in scope, on this tree and on `origin/main`, and the build
fails if this change RAISES the count. Nothing is stored. A new module-level
numeric constant in an unscoped file therefore cannot arrive silently — it
must come into scope with a ledger entry. (This is also the answer to
`stop_repair.py`: it defines no module-level numeric constant at all, so
there is nothing there for either check to see.)

Inside a scoped file the structural rules are:
  * (a) module-level UPPER_CASE names bound to a number;
  * (b) numeric defaults on fields of a class whose name ends in `Config`;
  * (c) numeric defaults on function and method PARAMETERS
    (`max_pct: float = 5.0`), id `module.Qual.name(param)`;
  * (d) numeric attributes on ANY class, annotated or not
    (`STOP_LIMIT_BUFFER_PCT = 0.03` inside the broker class), id
    `module.Qual.attr`; and
  * (e) inline MULTIPLIER/DIVISOR literals in the band `FACTOR_BAND`
    ([0.5, 2.0), excluding +-1): `round(price * 0.995, 2)`,
    `deficit * 1.02`, `price * (1.01 if cover else 0.99)`. Id
    `module.Qual.function:factor[N]`, N counting such literals in that
    function in source order.

Rules (c)-(e) were added 2026-09-19 because (a)/(b) left live trade numbers
invisible: the queued-earnings weight cap and the correlated-cluster cap were
parameter defaults, the 3% stop-limit buffer was a class attribute, and board
item 138's 0.5%/1% order-price buffers were inline arithmetic. (c)-(e) apply
only to scoped modules, not to `src/config/__init__.py`'s named classes and not to the
unscoped sentinel, whose count stays defined as module-level constants.

Why (e) is a band and not "every literal". Every literal operand of
arithmetic in scope was listed on 2026-09-19: about seventy, and outside the
band they are unit conversions (10_000 bps, 365 days, 60 s, 1_000_000), float
epsilons and query paddings; inside it, every one was an order-price or
sizing margin. A literal whose other operand is also a literal (`365 * 5`) is
constant arithmetic, not a margin, and is skipped. Renumbering is a feature:
adding a factor above an existing one in the same function shifts N and
fails the gate, which puts the neighbouring entries back in front of a
reviewer.

Rule (b) predates (d) and is kept because `*Config` is this codebase's
settled name for "the tunables". Rule (d) widens it to every class; it did
not bury the signal, because result/DTO dataclasses (`GrossCeilingOutcome`,
`PortfolioVolEstimate`, `SizingDecision`) default their numbers to zero,
which is never a site. Measured 2026-09-19: rule (d) found 19 sites in
scope, one of them a DTO counter (`AgentResult.provider_requests = 1`).

"Bound to a number" means bound to a number however it is spelled. A default
written as a NAME (`min_position_risk_pct: float = STARTER_POSITION_RISK_PCT`)
or as constant arithmetic (`5 * 366`) used to return None from `_numeric` and
vanish — four in-scope fields were in exactly that state, and pointing such a
name at an unscoped module was a one-line way to make any number disappear.
Names are now resolved against the module's own constants and against the
repo modules it imports them from, and constant arithmetic is folded.

Numeric leaves inside tuple, list and dict literals are sites too. That is
not completeness for its own sake: `stop_atr_setup_scale` holds the
stop-width scalers as a tuple of pairs, and those multiply into every stop
distance.

SEVEN THINGS THE LEDGER IS CHECKED FOR:

  1. COVERAGE — every in-scope site has an entry. A new number fails.
  2. VALUE — the entry's recorded value equals the live literal, AND, where
     the field is reachable from `config/settings.yaml`, equals the DEPLOYED
     value there too. Without the second half the ledger pinned the code
     default while the desk traded the YAML: `risk.max_position_risk_pct`
     could go 5 -> 10 with this gate silent. 52 of the entries route that
     way (verified by resolving each `AppConfig` section to its class).
  3. GROUNDS — `sourced`/`instrument` require a `source` that is a URL or a
     `file:line`, because prose is not falsifiable by a non-author;
     `derived` requires naming its base; `arbitrary` requires a note, the
     open question in answerable form, and what it costs while unanswered.
  4. BASE DRIFT — a `derived` entry records `base_value`, the value its base
     held when the derivation was written. If the base later moves, the two
     disagree and the build fails. This is the *sourced once, unsourced
     later* class.
  5. RATCHET — the `arbitrary` count must EQUAL `MAX_ARBITRARY_ENTRIES`, not
     merely stay under it. A ceiling was gameable: move a trade constant into
     an unscoped file, delete its ledger row, and the build went green while
     the headline arbitrary count FELL and the number became less visible
     than before the gate existed. Equality means a row can only leave the
     ledger alongside a declared edit to the count. `MAX_ARBITRARY_ENTRIES`
     is not written by hand: it is the sum of the deltas in
     `config/number_ledger_history.yaml`, one appended entry per change,
     each stating why.
  6. UNSCOPED SENTINEL — `scripts/unscoped_number_guard.py`, above.
  7. CITATIONS RESOLVE — every `path:line` an entry cites must exist and
     the line must be inside the file. It cannot check that a citation
     SAYS what the entry claims, but it catches one nobody opened. It
     caught an invented document path during this gate's own rework.

WHAT THIS STRUCTURALLY CANNOT CATCH, stated here so the module is never cited
as if it covered more:

  * A WRONG source. This is the big one and it has already happened; see the
    second paragraph. Nothing here reads a citation and checks it is true.
  * A number outside scope that the sentinel's count ratchet lets through
    because something else in an unscoped file was deleted in the same
    commit.
  * A citation to a symbol that still exists but no longer means what the row
    says. Rule 7 resolves `path::Symbol` and `path@`text`` citations and
    rejects bare `path:line` ones (board item 225); it cannot judge whether
    the symbol is the right one.
  * A number computed at run time from live inputs, or a `default_factory`
    whose number lives in a function body.
  * Inline literals OUTSIDE rule (e)'s band or shape. Measured 2026-09-19:
    comparison thresholds (`abs(volume_change_pct) > 50`), additive offsets,
    divisors like the `/ 10.0` in `src/data/levels.py`'s level strength
    (board item 148), fallback arguments (`_risk_number(x, 25.0)`,
    `kwargs.get(k, 25.0)`), and keyword literals passed at a call site
    (`lookback_days=5`) are all invisible. Catching them by value needs a
    list of "boring" numbers, which is itself an arbitrary list; the honest
    fix per site is to hoist the literal to a named constant, which (a)
    then sees.
  * A number in prompt PROSE. Measured 2026-09-18: ~1,825 numeric tokens
    across `config/prompts/*.md`, overwhelmingly dates and list numbering.
    That is board item 105 and it is not solvable this way.
  * The `arbitrary` entries themselves. The gate holds the boundary; it does
    not retroactively source anything.
