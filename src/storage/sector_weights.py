    ITEM 224 RECORDING, RECORDING ONLY, and it decides nothing. Read the
    `realised_sector_weights` note in `_migrate` for why it exists (the
    pre-decision projection was removed as undeliverable) and for the
    hard limit on its use: nothing may read it back into a sizing,
    ordering or refusal decision, and it may NEVER be swept for the
    sector cap that would have performed best.

    `decisions` is the FINISHED order list the constructor returned, so
    the figures are what was built and not what was hoped for; `sectors`
    is the constructor's own `last_order_sectors`, the sector it already
    resolved while sizing, so this write buys no market data and cannot
    disagree with the sizing it describes.

    Unknown sector stays NULL inside the JSON, never an "other" bucket.
    New recordings never have a NULL `weights_json`. A run that built no
    entry or reducing orders writes `[]`; a historical NULL remains unknown.

    Idempotent per run (UNIQUE on `run_id`).
