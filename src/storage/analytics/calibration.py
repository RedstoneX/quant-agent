        the right answer for "what did the desk last decide about this name"
        and the wrong one for "how long has this trade been on". A scale-in
        mints no new position: `_assign_position_ids` hands every add the
        same `position_id` until net qty returns to flat. So the position's
        birthday is the EARLIEST executed opening row carrying that id, not
        the latest.

        Why this exists (measured 2026-09-30, live DB): the deterministic
        trail sliced its bars from the last buy's date, while taking the
        entry PRICE from `position.avg_entry`, which is blended across every
        add. On 2026-09-23 MRVL's position (`pos-08b43df53103`, opened
        2026-09-17) took a third add at 17:19; the 19:31 trail evaluation
        therefore saw ZERO bars "since entry" for a position that was four
        sessions old, and `src/risk/trailing.py::_swing_lows` — which needs
        `2 * PIVOT_WINDOW + 1` = 7 bars before it can confirm anything — had
        nothing to read. See `tests/test_position_open_timestamp.py`.

        This lookup makes the trail's window LONGER, and a longer window is
        not automatically safer — the PR that added this said it was, and
        that was untrue. A longer window can only raise the chandelier's
        high-water anchor, and `src/risk/trailing.py::evaluate_trailing_stop`
        REFUSES outright once the resulting candidate rises through its
        noise floor instead of falling back to a lower one, so a wider
        window can cost a tighten the narrower window took. The reason to
        do it anyway is consistency: the caller takes the entry PRICE from
        `position.avg_entry`, blended across every add, so slicing bars from
        the last add alone was incoherent by construction. Measured against
        all 21 recorded refusals on 2026-09-30, the cost is currently zero;
        see the `_swing_lows` docstring for that measurement.

        Returns the timestamp string as stored, or None when `buy_row` is
        missing or carries no `position_id` (legacy rows predating the id,
        and rows the backfill could not chain). None means "unknown", never
        a guessed date — the caller keeps its own fallback.

        never opened with. `setup_type` and `structural_ceiling` are pinned

        Matches each BUY to the next SELL-family action (SELL, PARTIAL_SELL%,
        EMERGENCY_SELL, FORCE_DELEVER, REDUCE, TAKE_PROFIT, STOP_OUT, and a
        FILLED TRAIL_STOP) for the same symbol, FIFO. Open positions are
        excluded because their outcome isn't known yet.

        Stage 3 (shorts): a SHORT opens no BUY lot, so before this fix a
        COVER closed nothing — every short round-trip was invisible to win
        rate, avg return, and avg hold days, which reach the Portfolio
        Manager as settled fact (Quantitative Facts / L2 Trade Calibration).
        That was harmless while shorts could not be opened; Stage 3 makes
        them openable, turning the gap into a live accounting hole. Mirrors
        the BUY-lot machinery with a SEPARATE FIFO queue: SHORT opens a
        short lot, matched to the next COVER-family action (COVER,
        PARTIAL_COVER%, EMERGENCY_COVER) for the same symbol. A short's
        `return_pct` is signed the OPPOSITE way a long's is — closing BELOW
        the entry is the win, closing ABOVE it is the loss — mirroring the
        same sign convention already established for `unrealized_pnl` /
        `market_value` (negative qty) and for `position_reviewer`'s P&L%.

        Bucketed by allocation size (proxy for conviction): a larger dollar
        commitment implies higher conviction when PM sized it. Lets PM see
        "my high-conviction bets have been winning / losing" without an
        explicit conviction column in trades. Also bucketed by side
