"""Migration step: `trend_exit_tick_checks`, which completed daily bar the trend exit last ran on, per holding.

Owner ruling 2026-10-09: the trend exit runs at every 30-minute check on DAILY closes only. A new
completed bar appears once a day, so the check runs once per holding per new bar; this row is what
lets later ticks the same day skip it, and retry only a sale the guarded sell path refused
(see src/intraday/trend_exit_tick.py). One row per symbol. Idempotent.
