"""Migration step: `trade_refusals`, one row per NAMED refusal or named OBSERVATION, by its numbers.

Board item 218 (owner ruling 2026-10-01). The parity refusal is an explicitly PROVISIONAL
trial -- "for now ... see if that improves the desk purchases" -- so the thing it refused has
to be recoverable as NUMBERS, not prose: one row per name per run, every quantity in its own
column, so "did refusing these improve the desk's purchases" is a query and not a grep.

Board item 223 (2026-10-01) adds `requested_risk_pct`, the risk the seat ASKED for, so a
sub-floor observation records the request itself and not only the floor it sat under.

`observed_gap_pct` (2026-10-05) carries the signed computed-vs-analyst target gap, one row
per comparison, so the ledger row `target_divergence_warn_pct` can be read off a
distribution instead of argued about. Nothing accumulates: every share is a read-time query.

Idempotent. Columns added after the table first shipped are ALTERed in for existing files.
