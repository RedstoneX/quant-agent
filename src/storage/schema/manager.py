"""Schema cluster lifted VERBATIM from src/storage/db.py (instalment 1 of the db rebuild).

Owns table creation and the irreversible, append-only migration ladder.
Standalone: the only collaborator is the open sqlite3 connection, passed
keyword-only, so it builds and runs with no Database/TradingPipeline behind
it (tests/boundary_harness.py). Database keeps same-named thin shims that
construct this per call.

Migration steps are NEVER reordered, renumbered or altered here: production
databases have already applied them.
