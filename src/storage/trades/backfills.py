def backfill_position_ids(ledger, *, dry_run: bool = False) -> dict:
    """One-time reconstruction of `position_id` chains for trades rows
    written before this column existed (Phase 6, §6.2a).

    Uses the exact same FIFO logic `_assign_position_ids` derives
    (matched by symbol, oldest-first, a BUY or a SHORT opens/adds, a
    recognized exit-family action for that side reduces — mirroring the
    accounting `compute_trade_calibration` already trusts for win-rate /
    avg-hold-days) so the backfilled chains never disagree with those
    numbers. Re-running this after 2026-08-31 assigns chains to short
    history that could not receive one before; a row that already carries
    an id is still never reassigned.

    Never guesses: a row this can't confidently attach to an open chain
    — typically the ledger's very first record for a symbol whose real
    position predates this system (a SELL/exit with no prior BUY on
    record), or a stray exit after the book had already gone flat — is
    left NULL rather than assigned a fabricated chain.

    Idempotent and safe to run against a database where live trading has
    already assigned SOME rows (because this migration shipped and
    started minting ids for new trades before the backfill got run
    against older history): a row that already carries a position_id is
    never reassigned, and the chain state used to fill in the gaps
    around it treats that id as ground truth.

    `dry_run=True` computes and reports without writing anything.

    Returns:
        {"total": int,            # every trades row in the database
         "already_assigned": int, # had a position_id before this ran

    """One-time reconstruction of the conviction-ledger columns (spec
    §7.2) for `trades` rows written before they existed.

    Two INDEPENDENT repairs, run together because both read `trades` in
    one pass (mirrors `backfill_position_ids`'s shape and safety
    posture — dry-run by default, idempotent, never guesses):

    1. `decision_id_status` on every exit-family row (see
       `_is_exit_family_for_decision_linking`) that predates the
       column. This is NEVER ambiguous, unlike `position_id`'s
       `left_null_ambiguous` case: every `insert_trade` / `insert_
       stop_out_trade` call site in this codebase is enumerated, and an
       exit row's `decision_id` is NULL if and only if the code path
       that wrote it never had one to attach. So every eligible row
       gets EITHER 'linked' or 'no_originating_decision' — there is no
       third "can't tell" bucket the way position_id has.

    2. `conviction` / `requested_risk_pct` / `decision_model` on BUY/
       SHORT rows that already carry a real `decision_id`: recovered by
       joining `agent_logs` (agent_name='portfolio_manager', matching
       decision_id) and reading the `targets` entry matching this
       trade's symbol out of `full_response` (see
       `_find_pm_target_for_symbol` — handles both the fenced-```json
       and raw-JSON formats seen in real history).

       `allocated_risk_pct` (the POST-clamp figure the constructor's
       RiskPlan actually granted) is DELIBERATELY NEVER backfilled —
       it was never persisted anywhere retroactively readable (only
       the PM's pre-clamp ask survives, inside `full_response`), and
       reconstructing the granted figure would mean re-running the
       constructor's budget rationing against point-in-time book state
       this database does not fully preserve. Every backfilled row
       gets `allocated_risk_pct = NULL`, always, and the returned dict
       reports that as `allocated_risk_pct_recoverable: 0` rather than
       letting a caller assume the gap was closed.

    Idempotent: an exit row is only touched while `decision_id_status
    IS NULL`; an entry row only while `conviction IS NULL AND
    decision_model IS NULL` (a row already touched by this backfill,
    or by live trading after this column existed, is never
    reprocessed). `dry_run=True` (default) computes and returns counts
    without writing.
