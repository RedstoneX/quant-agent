    at session start: the pending row's sell_order_id is re-queried
    for terminal status, and if now terminal, the persisted specs
    drive a fresh finalize attempt.

    `side` is the PROTECTIVE-STOP / closing-order side, which coincide:
    "sell" (default) for a LONG (its protective stop is a SELL below
    entry, and a long is closed by selling) and "buy" for a SHORT (its
    protective stop is a BUY above entry, and a short is closed by
    covering). This is the REAL side, known at write time by whoever is
    closing the position, and is read back by
    `TradingPipeline._resolve_wal_row_side` under exactly this
    convention. (An earlier version of this docstring stated the
    mapping backwards — long→"buy", short→"sell" — which never matched
    the writers or the reader; corrected here.) NULL only for a row
    written before this column existed; the drain path treats NULL as
    the long-assuming fallback (see
    `TradingPipeline._derive_close_side_for_drain`).

    SCALE-IN rows (sell_order_id == `scale_in.WAL_SCALE_IN_SENTINEL`)
    follow the IDENTICAL convention, but they are dispatched to
    `scale_in.drain_scale_in_row` by their sentinel BEFORE any generic
    side reader runs, and that drain classifies long/short from the SIGN
    of `position_qty_before_sell` rather than this column — so a scale-in
    row is never interpreted with a generic reader's meaning either way.
