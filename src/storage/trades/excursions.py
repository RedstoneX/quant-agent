    limit on its use: it may show whether the floor was ever VIOLATED in
    practice, and it may NOT be optimised against to produce a new
    multiplier. Doctrine bars fitting a number to this desk's history.

    Monotonic: the stored figure only ever widens while the position is
    open, so a recovery cannot erase the excursion that preceded it. It
    is written onto the OPENING rows of the position (the rows carrying
    `entry_atr`), which is where a later reader joins entry ATR, stop
    basis, excursion and realised outcome together.

    Side-agnostic: "against" is below entry for a long and above entry
    for a short, decided from the sign of `qty` rather than from a
    stored action, because that is the only side fact a broker position
    snapshot carries. A zero or missing entry price is skipped rather

    ITEM 55 RECORDING, FALSIFICATION ONLY, and it decides nothing. The

    is the running half that says what price then did to it, so that
    "is this a real level" becomes answerable from the desk's own
    record instead of from argument. Read the `stop_level_basis`
    migration note for the hard limit on its use: it may show the
    current definition of a level is WRONG, and it may NEVER be swept
    for a better pivot window or zone width.

    TWO RAW DISTANCES, NO VERDICT. `level_max_penetration` is how far
    beyond the zone's FAR edge price has travelled (monotonic upward,
    never negative); `level_closest_approach` is the smallest gap ever
    seen to the zone's NEAR edge (monotonic downward, signed, negative
    once price is inside). Nothing here calls an outcome "respected",
    "pierced" or "broken", because each of those needs a cutoff nobody

    these numbers, which were never rounded to one.
