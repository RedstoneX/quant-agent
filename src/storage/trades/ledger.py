"""Trade-ledger write path lifted VERBATIM from src/storage/db.py (db rebuild instalment 3).

Everything that writes or reads the `trades` table and its satellites
(trade_refusals, pending_protection_restores, protection_restore_wal_audit,
pending_repegs, positions): inserts, fill/submit state transitions, stop and
take-profit amendments, stop-out recording, excursion accumulation, the
restore/repeg recovery queues, pruning and the two backfills. Standalone:
collaborators are the open sqlite3 connection, the Database lock, the
locked-write runner and the three small SQL/time helpers, all keyword-only,
so it builds with no Database/TradingPipeline behind it
(tests/boundary_harness.py). Database keeps same-named thin shims that
construct this per call.

The module-level helpers and constants (position-id assignment, exit
vocabulary, exit-reason categorisation, decision-id resolution, PM-target
extraction) now live in position_chain.py and are re-imported here, so
`from src.storage.db import _assign_position_ids` keeps working (one
definition, there). The backfills, the restore/repeg recovery queues and the
excursion/gap/positions bodies live in backfills.py, recovery_queues.py and
excursions.py; the same-named methods below are thin shims over them.

        `entry_atr` / `stop_basis` are STOP-FLOOR EVIDENCE, pinned at entry
        only, and are recorded for one purpose: so a future pass can ask
        whether the ratified minimum stop width was ever VIOLATED in
        practice. See `_accumulate_excursions` for the MAE/MFE legs and
        for the explicit limits on what this data may be used for.


        `fill_status` semantics:
          - 'submitted'  — sent to broker, terminal status pending
          - 'filled'     — broker confirmed execution (full or partial)
          - 'canceled' / 'rejected' / 'expired' / 'done_for_day' — terminal broker
                           status; may still carry fill_qty/fill_price for partial fills
          - None         — legacy row or non-executed audit row (currently HOLD).
                           Legacy BUY/SELL rows still count as executed for back-compat;
                           synthetic HOLD rows are explicitly excluded from executed_only.

        `position_id`, `exit_reason_category`, and `decision_id_status`
        (Phase 6, §6.2a/e; conviction ledger §7.2) are ALWAYS derived here,
        never accepted as arguments — see `_resolve_new_row_position_id`,
        `_categorize_exit_reason`, and `_resolve_decision_id_status`. Every
        one of this method's ~12 call sites across the codebase gets the
        chain-linking, exit classification, and decision-link labelling for
        free with no change to the call.

        `conviction` / `requested_risk_pct` / `allocated_risk_pct` /
        `decision_model` are the conviction ledger (§7.2) — pinned at ENTRY
        only (see `TradeDecision` in models.py for what each figure means);
        every existing caller that never passes them gets None, which is
        correct for every non-entry row and every legacy caller.

        `thesis_invalid_if` mirrors that same entry-only pinning — see
        `TradeDecision.thesis_invalid_if` in models.py. None for every
        non-entry row, every legacy caller, and any entry whose target
        stated no falsifier condition.

        `structural_ceiling` (item 82) is the MEASURED half of construction's
        breakout verdict, pinned at ENTRY (BUY/SHORT) only — see
        `TradeDecision.structural_ceiling` in models.py. Stored as 0/1; None

        BUY / SWEEP_BUY add executed qty; every other non-HOLD executed
        action subtracts it — mirrors the accounting `_realized_pnl_
        through_trade` and `compute_trade_calibration` already do,
        collapsed to a running total per symbol instead of per-lot detail,
        because this function only needs to know WHETHER the ledger and
        the broker still agree, not how a mismatch would price out.

        This is the ledger's own, self-contained belief — it has no idea
        the broker did anything it was never told about. Comparing this
        number against `AlpacaBroker.get_positions()` is exactly how the
        2026-08-28 ONDS/CCJ gap was found: both BUY rows left this
        function reporting 17 and 2 shares respectively long after the
        broker's own book had gone to zero, because the protective stop
        that closed them was never written back to `trades`.
        `_reconcile_stop_out_fills` (src/pipeline.py) is the caller that
        acts on a mismatch.

        TRAIL_STOP IS THE ONE ACTION THIS CANNOT SIGN FROM THE ACTION NAME
        (fixed 2026-09-23). Every other exit-family row is written only
        once the desk has decided to sell, but a TRAIL_STOP row is written
        at PLACEMENT — protection resting at the broker, which may never
        fire. `_executed_trade_predicate` lets a legacy `fill_status IS
        NULL` placement through, and signing it -1 subtracted the whole
        protected position from the ledger's belief. Measured on the
        production DB 2026-09-23, that made the ledger read AMD 0 (1.7662
        actually held, so a real AMD stop-out would never have been
        detected — the caller skips any symbol it believes is flat) and
        drove COP/EQNR negative. The rule here is the quantity the broker
        actually EXECUTED (`_trail_stop_reduced_position`).

        `_is_filled_trail_stop`, `compute_trade_calibration`,
        `_assign_position_ids` and `_categorize_exit_reason` all separate
        a resting stop from a fired one too, but they ask the NARROWER
        question — "is this a priceable realized exit" — and this function
        deliberately departs from them on one row shape: a stop that
        partially filled and was then canceled is not a round trip they
        can price, yet its shares really did leave the book. See
        `_trail_stop_reduced_position` for why that is not drift.

        SIGNED BY POSITION SIDE, corrected on the short side (item 173(c),
        2026-09-25). Both short-retiring routes now sign +1: a COVER-family
        action (COVER / EMERGENCY_COVER / PARTIAL_COVER) is a buy-to-cover by
        name, and a FILLED TRAIL_STOP resting on a short is a buy-to-cover
        read from the running net (its side is not in its name). Before this,
        every non-BUY row signed -1, so a SHORT 36 covered in full read -72,
        not 0 whether it came as a COVER or as a filled buy-to-cover
        TRAIL_STOP [measured 2026-09-23]. The caller
        `_reconcile_stop_out_fills` is LONG-only and skips any negative, so
        no live behaviour changed today; the ledger's own belief is simply
        now correct for the day shorts are enabled.

        for a row that does not exist yet rather than one already
        'submitted'.

        `realized_pnl` is computed the instant the row exists, via the

        (`_realized_pnl_through_trade`) — it stays NULL, not a guess, when

        unmatched exit; `_reconcile_stop_out_fills` flags that case rather
        than silently accepting an unpriced row).

        `action` (item 173(a)): the caller sets this from the broker fill's
        own order_type — STOP_OUT only when the broker order really was a
        protective stop, SELL for a market/limit exit, and RECONCILED_EXIT
        when the type does not prove it was a stop. It defaults to STOP_OUT
        only for backward compatibility with callers that pass none; the
        reconciler always passes it explicitly so a recovered exit is never
        labelled a protective stop the broker record can't substantiate.

        Returns `(row_id, created)`. `created=False` means the order was
