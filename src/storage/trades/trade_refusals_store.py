"""Storage for `trade_refusals` (schema: src/storage/schema/trade_refusal_tables.py).

Functions take the `TradeLedger` (`db._trades()`), so the big ledger file does not grow.

`PortfolioConstructor.last_refusals` keeps the human sentence and is drained only for the
symbols that reach `constructor_dropped`; this is the durable half, written at the moment of
refusal, and it stores no English at all. A trial the owner asked to judge later ("see if
that improves the desk purchases") is judged from these columns.

An OBSERVATION is not a refusal and must never be read as one. A sub-floor risk request
(board item 223) is NOT refused and NOT resized, only recorded, as `stage="observed_not_refused"`
with the request in `requested_risk_pct` and the floor in `threshold`. A computed-vs-analyst
target comparison lands the same way, with the signed gap in `observed_gap_pct` and the warn
threshold in `threshold`. Read `refusal` and `stage` together before counting anything here
as a declined trade.
