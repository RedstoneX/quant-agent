"""Board item 186 — the realised portfolio and cluster concentration recording.

Table, writer and payload shaping all live here, together, so a new recording
adds no mass to `src/storage/db.py` or to the schema manager (both are under
the rebuild's shrink-only size ratchet). `src.number_sources._DB_SOURCE_PATHS`
names this file, the same way the trades write path was named when it was
lifted out, so the settlement-route guard still sees the fields it writes.

WHY IT EXISTS. `max_portfolio_risk_pct` (25) and `max_cluster_risk_share_pct`
(40) are owner-ratified appetite with no measurement behind either, and the
owner's 2026-09-30 ruling ("risk is per-name, never a global dial") bars both
re-deriving them and deleting them while no per-name read exists. What is
left is to stop asserting the concentration they govern and observe it.

RECORDING ONLY. Nothing may read these rows back into a sizing, ordering or
refusal decision, and they may NEVER be swept for the ceiling that would have
performed best — that is fitting a number to this desk's own record, which
`docs/OUTCOME.md` bars.

UNIT: percent of equity AT RISK (per-name loss-if-stopped / equity), not
notional weight. `share_of_committed_pct` is the share of the committed
total, which is the quantity the 40% ceiling is actually written in.

UNKNOWN STAYS NULL: `allocation is None` means the held book's risk could not
be read and the allocator never ran — the state in which the ceilings go
UNENFORCED — which is not the same fact as a book carrying no risk. Every
measurement is then None and `allocator_ran` is 0.
