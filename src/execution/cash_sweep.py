"""Idle-cash sweep: park excess cash in a T-bill ETF, release it on demand.

Motivation (2026-07-16 forensics): the account sat at ~84% idle cash for
weeks while short-dated T-bills yielded 4%+. On a ~$100k book that is
~$300/month of risk-free carry left on the table — and unlike everything
else in this system, capturing it requires no forecast at all.

Design contract (mirrors CLAUDE.md 金额/仓位语义):

1. The sweep vehicle (default SGOV) is CASH-EQUIVALENT, never a position:
   - excluded from every LLM-facing view (PM / position_reviewer / evening
     builders) — the LLM never reasons about it, never sells it, never
     counts it toward exposure;
   - its market value counts as CASH in `_filter_hard_risk_decisions`
     (cash_only) and is excluded from net-exposure math, so parked cash can
     never block a legitimate BUY;
   - exempt from `_reconcile_stop_coverage` (it deliberately carries no
     protective stop — a T-bill ladder gapping 5% is not a scenario stops
     defend against);
   - `_force_delever` liquidates it FIRST (before any real long) when the
     account drifts into margin.

2. Deterministic and zero-LLM. Both bookend operations — the pre-BUY
   funding sale and the end-of-session parking purchase — were REMOVED in
   docs/WORK.md item 190. What remains is `release_retired_vehicle`, the
   one-way exit for a vehicle still held after the sweep was switched off.

3. SELL discipline: funding sells go through
   `pipeline._submit_protected_sell` + `_finalize_pending_protections`,
   exactly like FORCE_DELEVER — the vehicle has no stops so the
   cancel/restore halves are no-ops, but the WAL bookkeeping stays uniform
   with every other SELL path (a future stop on the vehicle would be
   handled instead of orphaned).

4. Ledger isolation: trades are recorded as SWEEP_BUY / SWEEP_SELL. Those
   action names are deliberately ABSENT from every action-tuple consumer
   (evening grading, calibration, recent-sells builders), so parking churn
   never pollutes the learning loops.

Failure posture: every operation is best-effort and conservative. Any
uncertainty (broker query failed, non-finite numbers, open-order notional
unknowable) resolves to "do nothing this session" — an unswept dollar
costs basis points; an over-swept dollar can reject a real trade.
