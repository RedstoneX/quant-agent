"""Order-boundary gates that need no judgement call — the last deterministic
checks before a request object reaches the broker client. Kept OUT of
`src/execution/broker.py` so each can be built and tested alone.

`check_order_quantity` is the QUANTITY gate (2026-10-01 audit: the stop
PRICE was guarded at the boundary, the quantity was not — −5, 0, NaN and
1e9 all reached the client). It is a pure function; `AlpacaBroker`
gathers its live inputs and records a refusal as `rejected_bad_qty`,
the same shape as `rejected_bad_stop`.

No bound here is invented. Each cites its source:
  * finite / positive — inequalities, no number;
  * decimal places — 9: `src/pipeline_sizing.py` clamps the configured
    `fractional_share_decimals` to <= 9, the same grid
    `_FRACTIONAL_QTY_EPSILON` (1e-9) and `_split_protective_qty` use;
  * whole-share-only names — the broker's own `fractionable` flag
    (`AlpacaBroker.get_fractionability`);
  * notional ceiling — `RiskConfig.max_position_pct` (config/settings.yaml),
    the cap the risk stage already applies to the SUGGESTED allocation,
    re-applied here to the FINAL quantity x price;
  * sell ceiling — the quantity the broker itself reports held.

# Spec §11.1 HYBRID FRACTIONAL STOPS. Measured 2026-09-01 against the live
# paper account — treat as broker capability, not account state:
#
#   * a fractional-quantity order MUST be time_in_force=DAY. A fractional
#     GTC order is refused outright: "fractional orders must be DAY orders"
#     (code 42210000).
#   * a fractional order must be market, limit, stop or stop_limit. A
#     fractional TRAILING stop is refused at EVERY tif.
#   * ACCEPTED fractional: STOP/DAY, STOP_LIMIT/DAY, LIMIT/DAY.
#   * whole-share GTC stops are unaffected (control probe accepted).
#
# So a position of N.f shares cannot be covered by one durable order. It is
# covered by TWO: a GTC stop over floor(N.f) — which survives the close —
# and a DAY stop over the sub-share remainder, which lapses at 16:00 ET by
# design and is re-placed at the start of the next session. The remainder is
# a deliberate overnight exposure the owner accepted in exchange for being
# able to hold expensive names at all on a ~$10k account. NOT bounded under
# one share — a position that is itself sub-one-share lapses in full (see
# config/settings.yaml), and "the next session" only exists while the desk
# is running: `src/coverage_watchdog.py` is what says so when it is not.
#
# `_derive_stop_tif` is where that rule is MECHANICALLY enforced: every stop
# this class submits goes through `_submit_stop_limit_order`, and the tif is
# derived from the quantity there rather than chosen by each caller. A path
# that forgets the rule cannot exist, because no path gets to state it.
