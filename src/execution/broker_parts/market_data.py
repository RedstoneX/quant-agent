    `get_latest_price` answers "what is it worth" but throws away how it
    knew: a real trade print, or a quote the tape has not confirmed. It also
    never looked at WHEN the trade happened, so a thinly-traded name that
    last printed yesterday, or any read outside market hours, came back
    looking exactly like a live price. Callers that place or move real orders
    need the difference; the reporting callers do not, which is why
    `get_latest_price` keeps its old shape and this is additive.

    `source` is one of `last_trade`, `quote_mid`, `quote_ask`, `quote_bid`.

    Two freshness answers, because two kinds of caller need different
    strictness and collapsing them into one flag would either block ordinary
    trading or wave through yesterday's price:
      - `is_today` — the provider stamped this value with the current ET
        date, whether it is a trade or a quote. A live quote mid-session is
        a legitimate fill reference; yesterday's anything is not.
      - `is_today_print` — additionally a REAL trade print. Only this proves
        the tape actually traded there, which is what deciding where a stop
        belongs requires.
    An unstamped or naive timestamp fails visible rather than passing as
    live — the same rule `src.trading_calendar.live_price_is_today` already
    applies to research snapshots.
