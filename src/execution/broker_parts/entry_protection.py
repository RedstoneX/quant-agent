"""Entry protection, lifted verbatim from AlpacaBroker.place_entry_protection.

Wait for an entry to reach terminal, cancel a still-working remainder, then
place the protective stop for the ACTUAL filled quantity. `AlpacaBroker` keeps
a same-named one-line shim that calls `place_entry_protection(self, ...)`, and
every other broker member is reached through `broker.<name>`, so a class-level
patch on `AlpacaBroker` still bites.

`_ENTRY_FILL_TIMEOUT_S` stays defined (and ledgered) in `src.execution.broker`;
the shim passes the broker module's CURRENT value in by keyword, so a test that
patches `src.execution.broker._ENTRY_FILL_TIMEOUT_S` still reaches this body,
which reads the name byte-identically. `_ENTRY_SIDES` moved here with its
comment; `src.execution.broker` re-exports it.

    """Wait for an entry order to reach terminal, then place a GTC
    protective stop (stop-MARKET, guaranteed exit) for the ACTUAL filled
    qty.

    If the entry is STILL WORKING after the wait (slow tape, wide limit),
    the unfilled remainder is CANCELLED first — audit round 2: the 15s
    wait treated "still live" identically to "terminal 0-fill" and walked
    away, so a DAY entry limit could fill hours later with no stop
    watching it (and a resting BUY could even re-buy into a crash after an
    emergency liquidation). Cancelling converges the order; whatever DID
    fill by then gets its stop from the post-cancel re-read. Losing the
    unfilled remainder is the accepted cost of protection-first.

    THIS CANCEL IS THE END-OF-CYCLE CANCEL (owner-approved 2026-09-12),
    and its timing is derived, not chosen. This desk does not run
    continuously: it runs as separate scheduled SESSIONS — see
    `SESSION_WINDOWS` in `src/trading_calendar.py` — each a single
    process that analyses at the prices and levels of that moment,
    proposes entries, submits them, protects the fills, and EXITS. New
    entries come only from the morning session; the midday and close
    sessions review positions. (The systemd/launchd timer ticks every 30
    minutes, but that tick only asks `scripts/run_if_et_window.sh`
    whether a session is due; it is not a re-scan.) So "the decision
    cycle that created the order" is this very process, and its boundary
    is the point where this process stops waiting for the fill and moves
    on — which is exactly here. An entry that outlived its own session
    would be resting on a thesis nobody is still holding: the next
    session re-analyses from scratch at real current prices and will
    re-propose the trade if it still wants it. Cancelling here — rather
    than leaving a DAY order resting until 16:00 ET — is therefore
    binding the order's life to the desk's own heartbeat, not to a
    timeout somebody picked. There is deliberately no separate "cancel
    after N minutes" constant: the boundary IS the end of this stage, and
    stays correct if the session schedule ever changes. The only number
    in play is `_ENTRY_FILL_TIMEOUT_S`, the in-cycle patience for a fill,
    which predates this and is unchanged.

    `on_unfilled_cancel`, when given, is called with a small dict
    (`order_id`, `status`, `filled_qty`) after a still-working entry was
    cancelled here and the post-cancel re-read shows NOTHING filled under
    any id in its chain. The caller uses it to page the owner with the
    prices that were tried — this method does not know them. Not invoked
    for a partial fill (shares were acquired and the stop covers them)
    or for an order that reached terminal on its own. Never allowed to
    raise into this method.

    `side` is the ENTRY order's own side — "buy" opens or adds to a long
    (the only side any order path in this repo has ever submitted, hence
    the default), "sell"/"sell_short" opens a short. The protective stop
    is always the OPPOSITE side, at the opposite buffer: a SELL stop
    below a long, a BUY stop above a short. See `STOP_LIMIT_BUFFER_PCT`.

    `superseded_filled_qty` is shares this entry already acquired under a
    DIFFERENT order id — the ancestors of a re-peg chain. `order_id` is
    the last order in that chain, and Alpaca's fill counters do not carry
    across a replacement, so the shares an ancestor filled are invisible
    here. They are real shares in a real position, and a stop sized to
    only the last order's fill would leave them naked. Adding them is what
    keeps the invariant "every filled share is under a stop" true across a
    re-peg. Default 0.0: for every caller that never re-pegs, this method
    behaves exactly as it did before.

    `cover_full_position` (long scale-in path B, 2026-09-15): after a
    positive fill, size the protective sell to the broker's FULL
    position quantity, not this order's fill. A partial add on a name
    that already held shares would otherwise rearm a stop over the
    add alone and leave the original lot naked. `held_qty_before` is
    the fallback if the broker position cannot be read: fill + what
    was held, the two quantities already measured, not a third number.

    Returns the stop order dict, or None when nothing was placed (entry
    filled 0 / stop submit failed). Never raises — a failure here must not
    abort the session.

    Spec §11.1 guard 1: the stop submission now RETRIES immediately and
    hard before giving up (`_submit_protective_stop_retrying`). A None
    return therefore means the retries were exhausted, and the position is
    naked — the CALLER owes an owner alert on it (guard 2); the
    coverage-reconcile auto-repair belt remains the backstop, not the
    first line.
