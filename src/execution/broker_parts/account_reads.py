        the range (Thanksgiving, July 4, Christmas, Good Friday, etc.) is
        correctly excluded instead of silently counted as a session.

        Item 165: `trading_calendar.trading_sessions_held` documents this

        should prefer this method instead.

        Falls back to the weekday approximation on a calendar-query failure

        `is_trading_day` check raises: an outage cannot look like a holiday.
