"""Protective-stop submission, restore and replacement, lifted verbatim from AlpacaBroker.

Second broker instalment. A `StopPlacer` is built from its collaborators alone
(keyword-only), so stop submission with retry, restore after a cancel, `shift_stops_down` and `replace_stop_loss` run without an
`AlpacaBroker` or a TradingPipeline. `AlpacaBroker` keeps same-named thin
shims that build one per call, so a test that swaps the client (or one of the
cluster's own methods) after construction still hits the swap.

The module-level helpers and constants the bodies read as globals moved with
them; `src.execution.broker` re-exports every one so existing importers and
patch targets still resolve.

        The retry happens HERE, in the same call, milliseconds after the
        failure — not queued, not deferred to the next 30-minute sweep. The
        position is already open; a deferred retry is an open position with
        no stop for however long the defer lasts, which is the exact failure
        mode §11.1 was required to bound. See `_STOP_PLACEMENT_MAX_ATTEMPTS`
        for why the budget is three attempts over ~2 seconds and not more.

        Never raises. Returning None is the signal the CALLER must escalate
        on — a naked position that nobody is told about is strictly worse
        than one that fails loudly.

        WHOLE SHARE COUNTS (every short, and every long while
        `execution.fractional_enabled` is off) take a single GTC stop and
        this function behaves exactly as it always has, down to the returned
        shape: the broker's own response, untouched.

        A FRACTIONAL qty takes the HYBRID split instead, because the broker
        will not carry one durable order over it (measured 2026-09-01; see
        the `_FRACTIONAL_QTY_EPSILON` block comment):

            leg A   GTC stop over floor(qty)   — durable, survives the close
            leg B   DAY stop over the sub-share remainder — lapses at 16:00
                    ET BY DESIGN and is re-placed by the next session's
                    coverage sweep

        Under one share there is no leg A, so a sub-share position carries a
        DAY stop only. This REPLACES the old "try the exact fractional qty
        three times, then fall back to a whole-share stop" path: those three
        attempts are now known to be three guaranteed rejections costing ~2
        seconds of naked position each time, and the whole-share fallback
        they led to is exactly leg A, reached immediately instead.

        The returned dict is leg A's response (leg B's when there is no leg
        A) annotated with `covered_qty` / `uncovered_qty` / `gtc_qty` /
        `day_qty` / `hybrid`. `uncovered_qty` keeps the meaning every caller
        already reads it with: shares the broker is NOT watching right now.
        It is 0.0 when both legs land, which is the ordinary fractional
        success — so guard 2 stays silent on success and still fires on a
        genuine partial cover.

        side — "sell" (default) protects a long and fires as price falls;
        "buy" protects a short and fires as price rises. Defaults to "sell"
        so every pre-shorts call site (none of which pass `side`) keeps its
        behaviour.

        PRIMARY: a stop-MARKET (`StopOrderRequest`) — owner ratified
        2026-09-25 for a GUARANTEED exit. An elected market stop fills at the
        next print instead of resting unfilled past a limit on a gap, which
        is the exposure the stop exists to close. `limit_price` is therefore
        IGNORED on the primary order (a market stop has no limit).

        SAFETY FALLBACK: if the broker refuses the stop-MARKET for an
        unsupported order-type/tif combination
        (`_is_unsupported_stop_market_rejection`), this degrades to the
        original stop-LIMIT for the SAME leg so the position is never left
        unprotected — a market-stop refusal becomes a stop-limit, never no
        stop. Any OTHER rejection propagates unchanged. `STOP_LIMIT_BUFFER_PCT`
        and `limit_price` govern ONLY this fallback now (and the separate
        force-de-lever must-fill SELL), not the primary protective stop.

        When `limit_price` is not supplied, the fallback buffer must sit on
        the correct side of the trigger too: a SELL's limit belongs BELOW
        the stop (same STOP_LIMIT_BUFFER_PCT the entry-protection path
        uses), a BUY's belongs ABOVE it. A SELL limit placed above its stop,
        or a BUY limit placed below its, can never fill — the order looks
        accepted but is dead on arrival.

        TIME IN FORCE IS DERIVED FROM `qty`, NOT PASSED IN (spec §11.1
        hybrid fractional stops). Whole share counts get GTC exactly as
        before — every existing call site is byte-identical. A FRACTIONAL
        qty gets DAY, because the broker refuses a fractional GTC order
        outright (measured; see `_derive_stop_tif`). Putting the rule here
        rather than at each call site means every path that can submit a
        fractional stop — entry protection, the coverage repair, the WAL
        restore, the partial-sell reprotect, the ex-dividend shift — becomes
        broker-legal at once, and no future path can forget it.

        `replace_stop_loss` (trailing) and the partial-sell reprotect both
        cancel a position's existing stops and submit ONE order for the whole

        """Re-submit a set of cancelled stop specs. Best-effort per-spec —
        a single broker rejection doesn't abort the loop.

        `side` is the specs' own side — "sell" (default) restores stops that
        protect a long. `replace_stop_loss` is the one caller that can pass
        `side="buy"`, when the position it's trailing is a short; every
        other caller only ever restores a long's SELL stops, so the default
        keeps them unchanged.

        ``check_idempotency`` controls whether we first query broker for
        already-alive stops and skip matching specs:

        - **False (default; in-line rollback path)** — the caller just
          cancelled these specs moments ago in the same method
          (cancel_protective_stops or replace_stop_loss partial-cancel
          rollback). The cancelled stops are not alive anymore at the
          broker by construction; checking would just slow the rollback
          and risk false-positives on Alpaca's eventual-consistency
          window (pending_cancel orders sometimes still appear in
          get_orders briefly).

        - **True (drain path)** — the caller is replaying a recovery
          intent persisted from a previous session. Specs that landed
          successfully in an earlier drain pass are alive at the broker;
          re-submitting them now would trigger held_for_orders /
          duplicate-protection rejections. Query open sell-stops first
          and skip specs whose (qty, stop_price) match a live stop
          within 1¢ tolerance. This closes the drain re-submission race
          documented in the design audit — finalize's
          reprotect-raised / restore-raised paths return the full
          cancelled_specs list, and drain's length-equality narrowing
          (pipeline.py:1039) can't distinguish "all failed" from
          "partial succeeded then raised", so it leaves the row's
          specs unchanged. Idempotency defends against the resulting
          re-submit dupes at the broker layer.

        Returns ``(restored_count, failed_specs)``. With idempotency on,
        ``restored_count`` includes already-alive-skipped specs (from
        the caller's perspective, coverage is intact either way).

        price is amended ATOMICALLY via Alpaca's replace endpoint — measured against
        the broker on rehearsal account <redacted-rehearsal-account> on 2026-09-30: the old order goes
        to REPLACED, a new id is issued, and exactly ONE open stop covers the symbol at
        every instant. A refused amend leaves the ORIGINAL order resting untouched.

        FALLBACK PATH: the older cancel + resubmit sequence, kept for the shapes that
        measurement did not cover (more than one resting stop, a bracket/OTO leg, a stop
        whose qty does not match the position, or an amend whose outcome is unknown).
        That sequence is not atomic — it is the origin of the naked-position window this

        short's BUY stop invisible); the position's own qty sign — read

        possible — is the authoritative vote once there's something to cross-
