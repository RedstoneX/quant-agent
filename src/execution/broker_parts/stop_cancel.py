"""Protective-stop snapshot and cancel, lifted verbatim from AlpacaBroker.

`snapshot_protective_stops`, `cancel_snapshotted_stops`,
`cancel_protective_stops` and `cancel_stray_protective_stops` as module
functions taking the broker first. `AlpacaBroker` keeps a same-named one-line
shim for each, and every other broker member (including the composed calls
between these four) is reached through `broker.<name>`, so a class-level patch

    """List + snapshot open protective stop orders WITHOUT cancelling them.

    audit F1 (review #1): the write-ahead recovery row must be
    persisted BEFORE any broker mutation. Splitting the read
    (snapshot) from the write (cancel) lets the pipeline do
    snapshot → persist WAL → cancel, so a process kill anywhere
    from the cancel onward is recoverable. Previously the WAL insert
    ran AFTER cancel_protective_stops had already cancelled the
    stops at the broker — a kill in that window left a naked
    position with no recovery intent.

    `side` is the STOP order's own side: "sell" (default) finds the
    stops protecting a long; "buy" finds the stops protecting a short.
    Every existing caller cancels/restores/re-protects a long being
    SOLD, so the default is unchanged; the coverage reconciler is the
    one caller that passes `side="buy"` to check a short.

    Returns ``(ok, specs)``. ``ok`` is FALSE when the broker's own
    order listing failed — board item 172, and this used to be the
    single most dangerous lie on the read path.

    It was documented as "always True", because a listing API error was
    swallowed by `_list_open_protective_stop_orders` and surfaced as an
    empty list. An empty list means "this position has no protective
    stop", so a broker outage was reported to the desk as a CONFIRMED
    NAKED POSITION — and the coverage reconciler then repaired against
    it, placing a full-size stop on top of a live stop it could not
    see. Both the strongest possible false statement about loss
    protection and a duplicate-protection write, from one swallowed
    exception.

    Callers that ignore `ok` are no worse off than before: `specs` is
    still empty in that case. Callers that read it can tell "there is
    no stop" from "I could not ask", which is the whole distinction
    item 172 exists for.

    NOT true of every caller, and the first version of this docstring
    said it was. `TradingPipeline._cancel_stops_with_write_ahead` reads
    `ok` and skips the SELL on False, so making this return False where
    it previously always returned True changed the EXIT path as well as
    the read path — five exit call sites, none of them reviewed when
    that change was made. The test pinning that skip
    (`test_cancel_stops_with_write_ahead_skips_on_snapshot_failure`,
    added 2026-05-16) pinned unreachable code for four months, because
    until board item 172 `ok` could not be False [measured from
    `git log -S`, 2026-09-23]. Nobody chose that behaviour; it was
    inherited. What it does now is decided at that call site and
    documented there.

    THE READ IS RETRIED before it reports UNKNOWN. The listers have had
    no retry at all: one exception and the answer was "I cannot ask",
    which now costs a skipped exit. The desk's own derived retry shape
    for the stop path — `_STOP_PLACEMENT_MAX_ATTEMPTS` attempts with
    `_STOP_PLACEMENT_BACKOFF_S` backoff — is justified on the grounds
    that "every failure worth retrying is transient: a 429, a 5xx, a
    dropped connection". That argument is STRONGER for a read than for
    the write it was written for: a retried read cannot double-place
    anything. Same constants, so there is no new number here.

    Returns ``(success, cancelled_specs)``:
      - ``success`` is True iff every stop was cancelled cleanly (or
        none existed). Caller should skip the SELL on False.
      - ``cancelled_specs`` is the list of stop snapshots (qty,
        stop_price, limit_price) that were successfully cancelled.
        Caller uses this to:
          1. ``_restore_stop_orders`` if the SELL is rejected by
             the broker (rollback the cancellation so coverage is
             preserved).
          2. ``_submit_stop_limit_order`` on the residual qty after
             a *partial* exit (TAKE_PROFIT / REDUCE / PARTIAL_SELL)
             — without this, the residual position rides naked
             until the next session re-attaches an OTO stop.

    Why this exists: Alpaca rejects new SELL orders when shares are
    held_for_orders by an existing protective stop — the OTO stop-loss
    leg attached to a morning BUY, or a TRAIL_STOP placed by midday.
    Without clearing those holds first, REDUCE / SELL / EMERGENCY_SELL
    / TAKE_PROFIT all surface as 'insufficient qty available' rejects
    (2026-04-25 AMZN incident, related_orders=[<TRAIL_STOP id>]).

    On partial cancel failure (some succeed, then one raises) the
    already-cancelled stops are restored before returning False —
    same rollback discipline as ``replace_stop_loss``. The caller
    won't proceed with the SELL anyway, so leaving partial-cancelled
    state at the broker would just shrink coverage for no gain.

    Now composed from snapshot_protective_stops +
    cancel_snapshotted_stops (audit F1 review #1). The external
    contract is unchanged: no stops -> (True, []); all cancelled ->
    (True, specs); partial failure -> rolled back, (False, []).

    pipeline's write-ahead orchestrator instead so the recovery row
    lands before the cancel.
