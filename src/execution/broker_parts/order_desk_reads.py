    """Every FILLED sell-side order for `symbol` whose FILL happened at
    or after `after` — broker truth, independent of anything this
    process itself submitted or remembers.

    2026-08-28 ONDS/CCJ: both positions were closed by their broker-
    resident protective stop (a GTC stop-MARKET order — stop-limit only
    on the unsupported-combo fallback — placed by
    `place_entry_protection` / `_repair_stop_coverage` /
    `shift_stops_down`), and none of those paths ever write the STOP
    ORDER ITSELF into `trades` — only every system-DECIDED exit (SELL /
    REDUCE / TRAIL_STOP / SWEEP_SELL) does that, at submission time.
    `_reconcile_stop_out_fills` (src/pipeline.py) uses this method to
    ask the broker directly rather than trusting the ledger's own
    opinion of what happened, then diffs the result against
    `Database.get_known_broker_order_ids` to find fills the ledger has
    never recorded.

    `after` is applied CLIENT-SIDE against each order's `filled_at`,
    deliberately NOT passed to Alpaca's own `after=` query parameter
    (unlike `list_recent_orders`, which correctly uses it that way for
    its own purpose). Alpaca's `after`/`until` filter on `submitted_at`
    — when it was ACCEPTED, not when it EXECUTED — and a GTC protective
    stop is typically submitted at entry and can rest for a long time
    before firing. Verified 2026-08-28 against the real paper account
    (MRVL): the stop was submitted 2026-08-21 13:35 and filled
    2026-08-24 13:48 — a naive `after=now-7d` broker-side query anchored
    4 days before "now" would have excluded it entirely (its
    submitted_at sat 7h before that cutoff) even though the FILL was
    comfortably inside the 7-day window everyone actually cares about.
    Silently missing a stop-out because the underlying order happened
    to be placed slightly outside an arbitrary lookback is exactly the
    failure mode this reconciler exists to prevent, so the broker query
    below is intentionally unbounded on symbol+side and every date
    filtering happens here, against the field that actually means
    "when did this become a real exit".

    Distinct from `list_recent_orders`: that method returns orders of
    ANY status and is used by the orphan-BUY sweep to match a KNOWN
    write-ahead row by qty, submitted within a tight recent window —
    `submitted_at` is exactly the right anchor there. This method is
    scoped to already-FILLED sells and is used to discover fills the
    ledger has NEVER SEEN, including ones this process itself placed at
    the broker (a protective stop) but never logged — `filled_at` is
    the only anchor that means what the caller needs it to mean.

    Returns None on a query failure — the caller must retry on the
    next reconciliation pass rather than concluding "no fills" and
    risking a missed exit (same None-means-retry contract as
    `list_recent_orders`). On success, a list of lightweight dicts:
    {id, symbol, qty (the ACTUAL filled qty), price (the ACTUAL filled
    avg price), filled_at (ISO-8601 UTC string, or None if the broker
    didn't report one), order_type} — orders with no filled_at at all
    are KEPT (never silently excluded by the date filter; None means
    "unknown timing", not "too old").
