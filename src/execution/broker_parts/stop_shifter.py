"""The ex-dividend stop shift as a PART (item 201 body, moved verbatim).

`StopShifter` is constructed from its six collaborators (keyword-only) and
exercised without a `StopPlacer` or a broker. `shift_stops_down`'s body is
byte-for-byte the mixin body it replaces; only the object that supplies the
collaborators changed. The placer builds one PER CALL (see stop_shift.py), so
a collaborator swapped on the placer after construction is what the body sees
-- the same live-handoff discipline as `AlpacaBroker._stop_placer`.

This is the live stop path: a shift is one-way and can tighten a real stop.
Nothing here alters a number, an ordering or a branch.

        Ex-dividend flow (audit round 2): the old path read ONE stop level
        (first-match) and replace_stop_loss'd ALL stops with a single
        consolidated order — with per-BUY GTC stops now the steady state,
        that collapsed distinct per-lot levels into one and could TIGHTEN a
        wide lot's stop to the tightest lot's level. Shifting each spec
        keeps the per-lot geometry and just absorbs the mechanical gap.

        Item 201: a shift moves PRICE only, so when every resting stop is the
        measured-safe shape each one is AMENDED IN PLACE and nothing is ever
        cancelled — the position is protected before, during and after. The
        cancel+resubmit below is now the fallback for shapes the measurement
        did not cover, and `mode` in the return says which path ran.

        Returns {"id", "status", "symbol", "shifted", "total", "mode"} or None
        when nothing was shifted. Best-effort with rollback: on the fallback,
        cancel failures roll back already-cancelled stops and re-place failures
        restore the ORIGINAL spec for that stop; on the amend path a failure
        leaves that stop resting at its old level, which is tighter than
        intended but never absent.

        SELL-stops only, deliberately not generalised to a short's BUY-stop
        (shorts-safe, Stage 2): the caller (`pipeline._handle_ex_dividends`)
        already excludes shorts before reaching this method, because the
        economics are genuinely different, not just the arithmetic sign — a
        long owns the shares and receives the dividend (the mechanical
        gap-down needs absorbing); a short instead OWES the dividend to the
        lender, a cash liability with no corresponding price-gap-absorption
        logic here. Mirroring the sign without modelling that liability
        would be a guess, not a fix.
