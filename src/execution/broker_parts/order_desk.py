"""Order submission, replacement, cancellation and order reads, lifted verbatim from AlpacaBroker.

Third broker instalment. An `OrderDesk` is built from its collaborators alone
(keyword-only), so `submit_order`, `replace_entry_limit`, the replacement-chain
follow, the polling waits and the open/filled-order reads run without an
`AlpacaBroker` or a TradingPipeline. `AlpacaBroker` keeps same-named thin shims
that build one per call, so a test that swaps the client (or one of the
cluster's own methods) after construction still hits the swap.

The stream-backed waits (`_wait_for_order_status`, `_wait_for_order_status_via_stream`
and its `_locked` half) stay on the broker: they read and write the live
trade-updates hub, the lease slot and the warm-up record, which are broker
state. They reach this desk through its shims and this desk reaches them as
collaborators.

The module-level helpers the bodies read as globals moved with them;
`src.execution.broker` re-exports every one so existing importers and patch
targets still resolve.

def _is_terminal_submission_rejection(exc: BaseException) -> bool:
    """True when Alpaca's OWN answer to a NEW-ORDER POST says it was refused.

    SEPARATE from `_is_terminal_broker_rejection` on purpose. That one is the
    retry classifier for STOP PLACEMENT (board item 129): its job is only to
    decide whether another attempt is worth making, and a false "terminal"
    there costs at worst an alert two seconds early. This one decides whether
    `submit_order` SWALLOWS the failure and hands the caller a
    `rejected_by_broker` result instead of raising — so a false positive here
    means the desk records an order as refused while the broker may actually
    be holding it. The two questions are not the same question, and the code
    set was inherited rather than re-checked when #786 reused it.

    Re-checked 2026-09-30 against Alpaca's own published documentation for
    the create-order endpoint:

      * https://docs.alpaca.markets/reference/postorder — the endpoint's own
        reference lists exactly three responses: 200 (the created order),
        403 ("Buying power or shares is not sufficient.") and 422 ("Input
        parameters are not recognized."). 404 is NOT among them; neither
        is 400.
      * https://alpaca.markets/learn/how-to-fix-common-trading-api-errors-at-alpaca
        — Alpaca's own troubleshooting guide for this API lists 422 for
        order-parameter errors and 403 for account/risk-control refusals,
        and names 400 only in a FUNDING flow, never for POST /v2/orders.

    So 422 is the one code both sources establish as "this order submission
    was rejected", and it is the only one that short-circuits here.

      * 404 is DROPPED. Nothing fetched shows Alpaca returning it for a
        creation POST; where 404 does appear in this API it means an
        addressed resource was not found (looking up / cancelling /
        replacing an order by id), which on a submission would read far more
        like "created, then not found" than "definitely rejected" — the
        dangerous direction, because treating a LIVE order as rejected leaves
        real exposure the desk believes it does not have. It is not kept on
        inheritance alone.
      * 400 is DROPPED for the same reason: not documented for this endpoint
        by either source above.
      * 403 is deliberately NOT ADDED even though it IS documented here. It
        is a different failure (buying power / shortability / PDT), the
        callers' existing exception paths already handle it, and widening
        what `submit_order` swallows is not what this classifier is for.

    A code that is not established simply keeps the pre-#786 behaviour: the
    exception propagates and the caller's own recovery runs.

        """Every FILLED sell-side order for `symbol` whose FILL happened at
        or after `after` — broker truth, independent of anything this
        process itself submitted or remembers.

        2026-08-28 ONDS/CCJ: both positions were closed by their broker-
        resident protective stop (a GTC stop-MARKET order — stop-limit only
        on the unsupported-combo fallback — placed by
        `place_entry_protection` / `_repair_stop_coverage` /
        `shift_stops_down`), and none of those paths ever write the STOP
        ORDER ITSELF into `trades` — only every system-DECIDED exit (SELL /
        REDUCE / TRAIL_STOP / SWEEP_SELL) does that, at submission time.
        `_reconcile_stop_out_fills` (src/pipeline.py) uses this method to
        ask the broker directly rather than trusting the ledger's own
        opinion of what happened, then diffs the result against
        `Database.get_known_broker_order_ids` to find fills the ledger has
        never recorded.

        `after` is applied CLIENT-SIDE against each order's `filled_at`,
        deliberately NOT passed to Alpaca's own `after=` query parameter
        (unlike `list_recent_orders`, which correctly uses it that way for
        its own purpose). Alpaca's `after`/`until` filter on `submitted_at`
        — when it was ACCEPTED, not when it EXECUTED — and a GTC protective
        stop is typically submitted at entry and can rest for a long time
        before firing. Verified 2026-08-28 against the real paper account
        (MRVL): the stop was submitted 2026-08-21 13:35 and filled
        2026-08-24 13:48 — a naive `after=now-7d` broker-side query anchored
        4 days before "now" would have excluded it entirely (its
        submitted_at sat 7h before that cutoff) even though the FILL was
        comfortably inside the 7-day window everyone actually cares about.
        Silently missing a stop-out because the underlying order happened
        to be placed slightly outside an arbitrary lookback is exactly the
        failure mode this reconciler exists to prevent, so the broker query
        below is intentionally unbounded on symbol+side and every date
        filtering happens here, against the field that actually means
        "when did this become a real exit".

        Distinct from `list_recent_orders`: that method returns orders of
        ANY status and is used by the orphan-BUY sweep to match a KNOWN
        write-ahead row by qty, submitted within a tight recent window —
        `submitted_at` is exactly the right anchor there. This method is
        scoped to already-FILLED sells and is used to discover fills the
        ledger has NEVER SEEN, including ones this process itself placed at
        the broker (a protective stop) but never logged — `filled_at` is
        the only anchor that means what the caller needs it to mean.

        Returns None on a query failure — the caller must retry on the
        next reconciliation pass rather than concluding "no fills" and
        risking a missed exit (same None-means-retry contract as
        `list_recent_orders`). On success, a list of lightweight dicts:
        {id, symbol, qty (the ACTUAL filled qty), price (the ACTUAL filled
        avg price), filled_at (ISO-8601 UTC string, or None if the broker
        didn't report one), order_type} — orders with no filled_at at all
        are KEPT (never silently excluded by the date filter; None means
        "unknown timing", not "too old").

        polling `get_order_by_id` on a fixed interval. A fill, cancel or
        reject is detected the instant Alpaca reports it, so the timeout no
        longer trades detection speed against giving a slow-to-fill order
        enough room; it is now purely a ceiling. This was the actual
        question the owner asked when the fixed-timeout number was under
        discussion: not "what should the number be" but "why are we
        guessing at all when Alpaca tells you the instant it happens."

        Three distinct outcomes from the stream attempt, each handled
        differently on purpose:
          - a terminal event arrived for THIS order -> return it immediately,
            no REST call needed at all.
          - the stream connected fine but nothing terminal arrived before
            `timeout_seconds` (a genuinely still-open order) -> one single
            REST check, to preserve this function's existing contract of
            returning the LAST KNOWN status (which may be non-terminal,
            e.g. "new") rather than None.
          - the stream itself could not be used at all (library missing,
            auth/network failure) -> fall back to the full REST polling
            loop exactly as this function worked before this change, so a
            websocket outage degrades to the old behaviour rather than to
            no behaviour.

        `use_stream=False` skips straight to REST polling — an explicit
        escape hatch for a misbehaving stream in production, and what unit
        tests use to exercise the polling path deterministically without
        real network I/O.

        # data-source glitch ($0.01 quote on a $300 stock, or an LLM
        # hallucinated entry). Submitting would turn qty sizing into
        # nonsense (5% alloc / $0.01 = 500x expected shares) and blow
        # through every risk check. Refuse the order.
        #
        # WHY THIS NO LONGER APPLIES TO THE STOP (2026-09-17, FLNC).
        # `OUTLIER_MAX_DEVIATION` is an unsourced 20% inherited from the
        # upstream project (ca4c51d9, yebof, 2026-04-18) and it was being
        # applied to the stop as well. A flat percentage band is the wrong
        # shape of test for a stop, for three reasons:
        #
        #   1. It is measured in the wrong units. A stop's distance from
        #      entry is a volatility distance, not a fixed fraction of
        #      price. FLNC's own measured ATR(14) on 2026-09-17 was $0.75
        #      against a $7.785 price — 9.6% — so a flat 20% band refuses
        #      any stop wider than ~2.1x that stock's ordinary daily range,
        #      while on a $500 name with a 1% ATR the same band permits 20
        #      ATRs. It bans nothing on a quiet stock and bans normal
        #      structure on a volatile one.
        #   2. It only catches the SAFE direction. A too-WIDE stop, under
        #      risk-based sizing, makes the position SMALLER (qty = risk
        #      budget / stop distance). The dangerous error is a too-TIGHT
        #      stop, which inflates size — and a deviation band never
        #      catches a tight stop at all, because a tight stop sits close
        #      to the reference by definition.
        #   3. It refused a trade the desk had already paid for. On
        #      2026-09-17 17:05:30 (production log) a risk-manager-approved
        #      SELL_SHORT FLNC — entry $7.785, stop $9.66, correct side,
        #      R/R 1.51:1, the constructor's own reading recorded as "stop
        #      width 2.50 x ATR, touch probability 20.7%" — was rejected
        #      here AFTER every analyst, portfolio-manager and risk-manager
        #      call had been billed.
        #
        # No replacement percentage is invented for the stop: there is no
        # published source for one, and per the desk's no-arbitrary-numbers
        # rule a fitted number would be no better than this one. What the
        # stop gets instead, below, are the two checks that need no number
        # at all — finiteness and side. The width question already belongs
        # to `src/portfolio_constructor.py::_widen_stop_past_noise`, which
        # measures it in the instrument's own ATR and honours a
        # level-backed stop however tight (spec §12.1). Nothing here
        # second-guesses that in percent.

        # it at 16:00 ET the same session, so any position bought in the
        # morning and not later given a midday/close TRAIL_STOP (which uses the
        # GTC `_submit_stop_limit_order` path) sat NAKED overnight — precisely
        # when gap risk is the reason the stop exists. Confirmed in production:
        # VST bought 2026-06-26 09:47 ET with SL=$158.75; the same evening's
        # coverage reconcile logged `VST held=31.0000 but only 0.0000 covered`;
        # it was ultimately exited at $152.77 for ~$185 more loss than the stop
        # would have capped. This also contradicted the close-session prompt,
        # which tells the reviewer to hold overnight *because* the broker stop
        # is standing watch.
        #
        # Placing the stop post-fill also fixes a second latent bug: the OTO
        # leg was sized to the REQUESTED qty, so a partial entry fill left a
        # stop covering more shares than we own. `_place_entry_protection`
        # keys the stop to the ACTUAL filled qty.

        """Block until Alpaca has FINISHED replacing `old_order_id`.

        2026-09-12: the entry chase is now a SINGLE decisive reprice (see
        `_repeg_entry_order`), so there is no second replace to sequence and
        this is no longer on the entry hot path. Kept because it is the
        correct primitive if a second replace is ever needed again, and the
        reasoning below is the reason a ladder was retired: every extra
        replace is another `pending_replace` window to get stuck in.

        Why this exists as a hard gate rather than an optimistic assumption:
        Alpaca refuses to replace an order whose status is `accepted`,
        `pending_new`, `pending_cancel` **or `pending_replace`** (its own
        Replace-Order reference). A replace is therefore not an instant
        edit — the order sits in `pending_replace` while the broker works,
        and a SECOND replace fired into that window is rejected outright.
        Chasing a running market means issuing several replaces in a row, so
        the sequencing is not a nicety: without this gate the second re-peg
        of any chase is a coin flip on broker timing.

        The confirmation signal is the OLD order reaching the terminal
        status `replaced` — which is exactly when Alpaca has completed the
        swap. That is read from the real-time `trade_updates` websocket
        first via `wait_for_order_terminal` (PR #287), so the ordinary case
        costs a few milliseconds rather than the whole timeout, and a
        websocket outage degrades to that method's own REST fallback rather
        than to no confirmation at all.

        Returns True only on positive evidence the swap completed:
          * the old order reports `replaced`, or
          * `resolve_replacement_chain` independently shows the old id now
            points at `new_order_id`.

        Anything else — timeout, an unreadable broker, a status that never
        settles — returns False, and the caller MUST stop chasing. "I could
        not confirm" and "it is safe to send another replace" are different
        statements, and conflating them is the whole failure mode this
        guards. Never raises.
