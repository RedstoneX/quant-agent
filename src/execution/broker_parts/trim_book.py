"""src.execution.broker_parts.trim_book -- a trimming exit shrinks its stop in place, never cancels it.

The broker-touching half of the trim path; reached ONLY through the broker
object (`AlpacaBroker.clear_stops_for_trim` / `settle_trim_book` /
`trim_keeps_shares`) so src.protection never imports src.execution. The
owner-facing half (refusal wording, WAL discharge) is src.protection.trim_amend.

THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. The four trims (REDUCE, PARTIAL_SELL, TAKE_PROFIT,
SWEEP_SELL) used the full-exit discipline: cancel EVERY protective stop,
sell, wait for the fill, re-place a stop on what is left. Between the
cancel and the re-place the KEPT shares had no stop at all.

WHAT WAS MEASURED on the sandbox (regular hours, 2026-10-09): selling
shares a resting stop holds is refused (403 40310000 held_for_orders); a
whole-share quantity PATCH on the stop answers 200 with a NEW id and marks
the old order "replaced", after which the freed shares sell while the kept
stop stays live; a FRACTIONAL quantity PATCH is refused (422 "qty must be
an integer"); a fractional stop must be DAY; a second stop over held shares
is refused.

THE PATH, per leg class (`book_shape` in stop_invariant.py: W whole shares
on a GTC leg, F sub-share on a DAY sliver):

  1. the GTC leg is PATCHED down to the KEPT whole quantity and the replace
     is CONFIRMED (old order terminal as "replaced", new order live and not
     pending) BEFORE the sell is submitted -- a pending replace holds
     max(old, new), so a sell sent earlier is refused;
  2. a sliver the sell needs shares from is cancelled on the existing
     write-ahead path, the sell goes, and the finalizer re-runs the stop
     quantity invariant on the fill so the sliver the position still needs
     is re-placed. The naked window is NOT removed on this leg: it SHRINKS
     to the sub-share, because the broker allows no quantity change on it;
  3. a refused PATCH re-reads the held quantity first (a stop may have
     fired); unchanged and the tape OPEN, the old cancel-all path runs;
     unchanged and the tape SHUT, the trim is refused and logged loudly --
     out of hours a cancel can land while the resubmit is refused;
  4. a full exit (kept == 0) never comes here; it keeps cancel-all.

Shorts: the buy-stop covering a short is PATCHED down the same way. The
403 on a BUY-to-cover was NOT measured, so the measured-safe path (refuse,
never sell against an unconfirmed book) is what a refusal falls to.

Where the new stop id goes: the desk persists stop LEVELS
(`trades.stop_loss`, stop_records.write_back_stop_loss), never ids -- the
trailing amend persists none either -- and the fill reconciler attributes a
stop-out by diffing broker fills against the ledger's own order ids, so a
fill on the replaced id is written as a stop-out exactly as one on the
original would be. The new id is carried on the pending-protection record
and logged; there is no id store to write it to.
