# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Idempotent order submission — one deterministic `client_order_id` per INTENT.
#
# WHY. Before this, every order was a fresh request with no deduplication key
# (`client_order_id` appeared nowhere in src/). Alpaca treats
# `client_order_id` as the order's idempotency key: a second POST carrying an
# id that an ACTIVE order already holds is refused with HTTP 422
# "client_order_id must be unique" (Alpaca's own troubleshooting guide,
# https://alpaca.markets/learn/how-to-fix-common-trading-api-errors-at-alpaca).
# Without a key, an HTTP timeout AFTER the broker accepted the order is
# indistinguishable from a rejection, and a resubmission in that window is a
# SECOND real position. The orphan sweep in src/pipeline_stages.py is
# after-the-fact recovery; this is prevention.
#
# THE KEY IS DERIVED, NEVER GENERATED. It is built only from stable facts of
# the intent — purpose, symbol, side, ET session date, quantity, price — so
# the SAME intent retried produces the SAME key (the broker refuses the
# duplicate) while a genuinely NEW intent (other side, other day, other size,
# a ratcheted stop trigger, a stop instead of an entry) produces a different
# one. No timestamp, random value or counter: any of those would make every
# retry look new and defeat the whole purpose.
#
# LENGTH LIMIT — cited, not chosen. Alpaca publishes two figures for this
# field: the Trading API reference for POST /v2/orders
# (https://docs.alpaca.markets/reference/postorder) says "<= 128 characters";
# the Broker API orders reference in Alpaca's own docs repository
# (https://github.com/alpacahq/alpaca-docs/blob/master/content/api-references/broker-api/trading/orders.md)
# says "<= 48 characters". The stricter of the two published limits is
# honoured so the key is valid under BOTH documents. Neither page specifies
# an allowed character set, so the key uses only characters Alpaca already
# accepts in this request's other fields: the symbol's own letters, digits
# and '.', plus '-' and hex digits.
#
# HASH WIDTH — derived, not chosen. When the natural key is longer than the
# limit, the readable prefix (purpose-symbol-date-) is kept and the remainder
# of the budget is filled with the SHA-256 hex digest of the full natural key;
# the digest width is simply whatever the limit leaves after the prefix.

    `supersedes` is the broker id of a DYING order (`pending_cancel`, or

    Adversary finding 2026-10-01: a duplicate-key 422 read back WITHOUT
    inspecting status counted a `pending_cancel` stop as live protection
    — the exact case `_restore_stop_orders` hits, since it resubmits the
    same qty/trigger/side moments after cancelling, while the cancel is
    still in flight and the key is therefore still held (Alpaca's rule
    is uniqueness among ACTIVE orders; a terminal order frees its key,
    so a fully `canceled` stop never produces this 422 at all). So:

    * duplicate 422 -> read the existing order back and INSPECT it;
    * status in `holds_shares_statuses` (resting,
      placement-pending, mid-amend `pending_replace`, executing
      `stopped`, or already executed) -> that order holds the shares;
      return it and NEVER place a second stop over it;
    * any other status (`pending_cancel`, `canceled`, `expired`,
      `rejected`, ...) -> holds nothing: derive a superseding key from
      the dying order's id (see `_client_order_id`) and submit a
      genuinely NEW stop. A dead replacement chains the same way; the
      loop ends because every hop names a distinct dead order and a
      never-seen key is accepted outright.

    What this does NOT guarantee: see the KNOWN LIMITATION in
    `_client_order_id` — a timed-out replacement retried after the
    prior stop's cancel completes is accepted as a second live stop.

    Every non-duplicate exception propagates untouched so the caller's
