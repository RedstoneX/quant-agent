#: the same reprotect, after excluding by order id every stop this run
#: itself cancelled. Nothing in this codebase reconciles a duplicate
#: protective stop (see `src/coverage_watchdog.py`, which states it never
#: cancels or modifies; the only duplicate handling anywhere is a message
#: asking the owner to cancel one by hand), so the duplicate must be
#: prevented rather than cleaned up.
#:
#: CORRECTED 2026-10-01 (adversary round 2, defect 2): that reader no
#: longer treats this union as one answer. A `pending_new` stop can still
#: become `rejected`, so it is neither protection to bank nor an order to
#: place a second stop over; the reprotect path reads the two member sets
#: SEPARATELY and gives the in-flight case its own outcome — no write-back,
#: no drain of the recovery intent, re-read on the next pass. The union is
#: kept as the vocabulary for "neither terminal nor dying".
#:
#: `pending_cancel` stays OUT of both sets: a dying order is never
#: protection, whichever question is being asked.

    # stop-LIMIT FALLBACK taken when the broker refuses a stop-market for an
    # unsupported type/tif combo, and (b) the force-de-lever must-fill SELL.
    #
    # 3% beyond the stop: a stop-MARKET fills at whatever the book has on a
    # gap (10%+ worse than the stop); a stop-limit caps the worst-case fill.

    # ("prioritize fill over price"). Trade-off on those fallback/de-lever
    # legs: on gaps beyond 3% the limit won't fill and the position stays
    # open until a session can act — which is exactly why the primary
    # protective stop is now market and not subject to this trade-off.

    # stop to have room to fill on the way down). A short's protective order
    # is a BUY stop, so its limit must sit 3% ABOVE the trigger — a BUY
    # needs headroom over the stop to fill on the way up. Getting this
    # backwards for a short is silent: the order still submits, but the
    # limit sits on the wrong side of the trigger, so it can never fill.
