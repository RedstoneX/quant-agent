"""Long scale-in path B: cancel the resting protective sell, confirm, buy, rearm.

Owner ruling 2026-09-15: a BUY add on a name that already has a resting
protective sell (stop / stop_limit) is allowed ONLY through this sequence,
never by silently refusing the add.

    1. Snapshot the protective sell and persist a WAL recovery row.
    2. Cancel it.
    3. Confirm the cancel via the broker's own order status — do not assume.
       (Was `trade_updates` first; that socket is off since 2026-09-17, so
       this is the bounded REST wait. Same call, same window.)
    4. Submit the BUY add.
    5. On any fill (including partial): place ONE protective sell covering
       the broker's FULL position quantity at the existing protection level
       (most-protective of the cancelled stop and the add's own stop).
    6. If rearm fails: fail-closed owner alert. Do not leave the position
       naked quietly.

WHY THIS EXISTS (Alpaca wash-trade / opposite-side block)
---------------------------------------------------------
A resting SELL stop and a new BUY cannot both be working on the same
symbol. The old whole-book daily breaker cancelled every protective stop,
failed to sell on a gap, and restored — leaving an unprotected window on
the exact day it existed for (`docs/INCIDENT_HISTORY.md`, 2026-09-14).
This path is the same cancel-to-free-shares shape, but:

  * it is one symbol, one add, not the whole book;
  * cancel is confirmed before the BUY is sent;
  * a crash mid-sequence is recovered from the WAL row using the broker's
    CURRENT quantity, never the cancelled-stop size or the add's fill size;
  * trail / in-session coverage repair / the coverage watchdog skip a
    symbol that has a live scale-in WAL row so they cannot re-place the
    stop we just cancelled (which would re-create the wash-trade block)
    and cannot resize it while the add is in flight.

SHORT ADDS
----------
Built (owner-approved), as the mirror of the long path: `prepare_short_add`
cancels a resting *buy*-stop, submits the SELL add, and rearms a buy-stop
covering the FULL enlarged short. Most-protective for a short is the LOWEST
trigger (covers soonest); the marketable limit sits ABOVE the trigger
(`stop * (1 + buffer)`) because a buy needs up-headroom. It adds two guards
the long path does not need: a wash-trade guard (the SELL add cannot rest
against a foreign working BUY) and an abort when a cancelled buy-stop FILLED
(the short was covered — do not restore a stop onto a flat name, do not open
a new short). A SHORT that opens a flat name is unchanged. Missing short
stops are repaired separately (item 73, closed).

No new magic percentages. The stop trigger is the live protective level
already at the broker (or the add's reviewed stop if that is tighter).
The 3% stop-limit buffer is `AlpacaBroker.STOP_LIMIT_BUFFER_PCT`, the
same one every other protective-stop path uses. `execution.repeg_enabled`
is not consulted and is not changed.
