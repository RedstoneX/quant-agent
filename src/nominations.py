"""Phase 9 — bounded nomination collection, cross-seat dedupe, and ranking.

`docs/QAMC_REMEDIATION_SPEC.md` §9.1/§9.2: before this, Technical was the
only seat that could originate a trade idea; every other seat could only
rate what Technical had already picked. A nomination lets News, Earnings
or Macro ask the desk to look at a symbol Technical did not already cover
— but the ask has to be bounded, or "any seat can nominate" degenerates
into "every seat re-originates the whole universe".

This module is pure logic only: no I/O, no LLM calls, no broker/market
access. That is deliberate — it keeps the cap/dedupe/ranking rules unit
testable without constructing a `TradingPipeline`. The deterministic
external-symbol admission gates (broker eligibility, price, liquidity,
history, sector — shared with the smart-money transient-admission lane)
live on `AdmissionService` (`_evaluate_external_admission_gates`),
since they need live broker/market access; this module only decides
WHICH symbols are worth gating, and in what order.

    have been refused by the gate rather than cut by a cap.
