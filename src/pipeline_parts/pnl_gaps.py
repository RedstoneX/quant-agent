    """`(total_pnl, total_return_pct, since_date)` for the Telegram
    feed's "total P&L" line.

    **Why "since reset" and not "since inception".** The desk's
    2026-09-02 book-wide liquidation archived every prior trade/
    daily_pnl row (see docs/INCIDENT_HISTORY.md); the live `daily_pnl`
    table has held no row earlier than that date since. A "total"
    spanning that boundary would silently splice pre-reset and
    post-reset history into one number the owner would act on as if it
    were continuous — exactly the defect he flagged. So the baseline
    is the EARLIEST row this table actually has, never reconstructed
    from the archive.

    **Why that row's `total_value - daily_pnl`, not its `equity_close`.**
    `equity_close` is that day's OWN 4pm close — already one day inside
    the post-reset period, which would drop that first day's P&L from
    the total. `total_value - daily_pnl` recovers the broker's
    last_equity going into that day (the same basis `daily_pnl` itself
    is built from everywhere else in this file), i.e. the account's
    equity immediately before the first post-reset trading day —
    a value already recorded on that row, not invented here.

    Returns `(None, None, None)` when no `daily_pnl` row exists yet
    (fresh DB) or the recorded baseline is non-finite/non-positive —
    never a fabricated 0.

    refusing a negative qty exactly as before (see _full_sell_qty

    Returns ``(side, qty)`` where ``side`` is ``'sell'`` to flatten a
    long or ``'buy'`` to cover a short, and ``qty`` is the ABSOLUTE
    number of shares — always positive, never the signed broker qty.

    Returns ``None`` when direction can't be determined (qty is zero,
    NaN, or otherwise not a finite nonzero number). This is the one
    design rule the reviewer called non-negotiable: a forced close is
    only safe when the side is certain, because guessing wrong on a
    short doesn't fail safe — a SELL aimed at a position that's
    actually already short would ADD to the short (sell more of a
    symbol you don't hold long), doubling the very exposure the
    forced close exists to shed. Refusing and logging loudly beats
    guessing every time; the caller is responsible for the loud log,
    this just refuses to hand back an answer to guess with.
