"""Per-symbol, per-trading-day owner-alert claims and the watchdog state file.

Lifted verbatim out of `src/coverage_watchdog.py` (2026-10-05) so that the
broker seam can claim a page without importing the watchdog. The watchdog
imports THIS module and re-exports every name; `src/execution/scale_in.py`
imports it directly. The dependency now runs one way:

    src.execution.scale_in -> src.alert_claims <- src.coverage_watchdog -> src.execution.scale_in

A claim is reserved BEFORE the message is handed to the notifier so two
processes finding the same condition at the same moment cannot both send;
`release_typed_alert` hands a claim back when the send did not land. Nothing
declined is dropped silently: `_record_suppressed_alert` keeps the count and
the last events in the same state file, which `src/api/db_reads.py` reads.
