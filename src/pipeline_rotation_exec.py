    zero-size PM target, when the desk's own data says it is safe to.

    Runs after the PM's plan is parsed and grounded and BEFORE
    `PortfolioConstructor.construct_orders`, so the close it proposes is
    built, risk-checked, reviewed and executed by exactly the machinery a
    PM-decided close goes through — `_build_sell`, the hard risk rules, the
    AI Risk Manager (which can refuse it by symbol), the holding-discipline
    claim check in `RiskStage`, and `_submit_protected_sell` in
    `ExecutionStage`. This function adds a target to the plan and records
    why; it never places an order and never removes anything the PM asked
    for. See `src/rotation.py` for the doctrine and the owner request.

    Every guard below fails CLOSED — an unanswerable question means no
    sale — and every refusal is recorded as a `rotation`/`skipped` event:

      1. `execution.rotation_enabled` must be explicitly True (else this
         function is a no-op and the run is byte-for-byte Phase 14).
      2. The PM's own prompt must have surfaced a comparison this session,
         and it must be the categorical tier. The ranked-margin tier is
         information only (see `src/rotation.py`).
      3. The held name must be a LONG the broker actually shows. KEPT, and
         re-examined under the 2026-10-01 ruling rather than inherited: this
         function only appends a zero-size `TargetPosition`, which
         `_build_sell` turns into a SELL, and the SELL execution loop
         hard-refuses a SELL on a short (`existing[0].qty <= 0: continue`).
         A short needs the separate COVER path, whose caps, protective
         BUY-stop cancel/replace and partial-fill restore have never been
         exercised from here. Removing the restriction today would therefore
         either do nothing or put an unverified order shape on live capital
         with the remainder's protection unproven — which the one-way
         protection rule forbids. It is a REPORTED GAP, not a silent one:
         below-bar SHORTS are recorded every session by
         `holdings_below_entry_bar` and skipped under their own audited
         reason, and automating the cover leg is its own piece of work.
      4. RANKED-MARGIN TIER ONLY: the PM must itself have targeted the new
         candidate with a real size this session. The CATEGORICAL tier no
         longer requires it (owner ruling 2026-10-01) — a holding below the
         desk's own entry bar is closed whether or not the book is full and
         whether or not anything is queued to replace it.
      5. The PM must not already be targeting the held symbol (closing it
         itself, or adding to it). Either way the model has spoken and
         this function does not override a decision the PM made.
      6. Nothing may be in flight on the held symbol: no trades row for
         it today still `submitted`/`pending_submit`, no BUY of it today at
         all (a day-zero exit "never given a single day's normal range to
         breathe" is exactly what the exit noise band exists to prevent —
         OKLO 2026-08-26), no pending protection-restore WAL row (a sell
         already mid-flight), no pending re-peg row (an entry mid-chase).
      7. RANKED-MARGIN TIER ONLY: its structural protection must ALREADY be
         broken under the item-25 holding-discipline check. That tier sells
         a still-ELIGIBLE name for opportunity cost, which is not one of the
         three real triggers. On the CATEGORICAL tier the holding is by
         definition no longer eligible, and the owner ruled on 2026-10-01
         that failing the fresh-entry bar IS the real trigger, so protection
         is measured and reported but does not veto.

    Returns `(clearance, reason, detail)`: exactly one of `clearance` (a
    `src.rotation.RotationClearance`) and `reason` is not None.

    Board item 39. Every gate below is the SAME computation the execution
    stage runs later, fed projected post-sale inputs — not a second
    implementation of it.

    The list below is FOUR long and so is `REQUIRED_BUY_LEG_GATES`; a
    `gate_coverage_incomplete` refusal at the bottom of this function is
    what keeps the two from drifting, and this paragraph is the third copy
    of the count, so change all three together. It was six until
    2026-09-23, when the owner's removal of the account-level loss halt
    (PR #584) deleted the `daily_loss_recheck` refusal (retired-ok) the
    first gate anticipated, and five until 2026-09-24, when `below_min_notional`
    (retired-ok) was deleted the same way: the flat $500 `min_order_usd` (deleted)
    notional floor it named was arbitrary, not a broker minimum, and Alpaca
    charges no stock commission, so `_prevent_rotation_naked_sale` no
    longer refuses a rotation's replacement buy for re-sizing small but
    nonzero — only a genuine zero still refuses, via `insufficient_cash`.
    Nothing replaced either deleted gate: the gross exposure the loss halt
    shared with the §11.2 ladder is still gated, by `insufficient_cash`.

      * `no_price` / `stale_entry` — `_live_fill_price` and the same 5%
        deviation test the preflight applies. Neither depends on the sale
        at all, so these are exact now, not projected.
      * `qty_zero` — the preflight's own sizing helpers (`_size_shares`,
        `_qty_by_risk_budget`, `_fractional_sizing_allowed`) at the
        projected equity.
      * `insufficient_cash` — `_entry_deployment_budget` over the
        projected post-sale positions, equity and settled cash, drained by
        every entry earlier in the same session exactly as the submit loop
        drains it. This is what still carries the §11.2 gross ladder: the
        budget's ladder-backed branch measures the headroom the sale
        frees, so a rotation that would breach gross is refused here even
        though the account-level alarm is gone.

    **What this does NOT close, stated plainly.** The BUY submit loop can
    still refuse an entry for reasons no pre-check can evaluate in advance:
    the latency window (`latency_window`), the borrow gate on a SHORT, and
    any broker rejection. (Board item 183, 2026-09-30: a displayed quote
    through the entry ceiling is no longer one of them — it is recorded as
    `venue_quote_through_ceiling` and the order is still sent, because the
    limit is its own protection.) Those are not knowable before the sale, and the tape
    can also move between this projection and the real check. This gate
    removes the deterministic, knowable refusals — the ones that made the
    naked-sale outcome reproducible — and the residual is recorded in the
    PR and in `docs/INCIDENT_HISTORY.md` rather than papered over.

    """The symbols this session will actually COVER when the rotation's
    close is gated, in the order they will be covered.

    **A cover that cannot move the book does not count.** The COVER loop
    refuses two classes outright — a COVER against a symbol that is not
    held short (`existing[0].qty >= 0`), and one with
    `allocation_pct == 0` — and both take zero shares off the book, change
    no intraday P&L and move no gross. Counting them would refuse the
    rotation for a cause with no effect, every session the PM keeps
    proposing that dead cover, which is a statement about the desk rather
    than about the market. `_projected_sale_qty` applies the same sign and
    allocation agreement the COVER loop itself applies, so the filter here
    and the loop there cannot drift apart.

    Board item 39. The COVER loop runs AFTER the SELL loop, so at gate time
    no cover has happened and none can be measured — unlike the other
    SELLs, which the reorder makes measurable.

    **This refusal has outlived the argument that produced it, and that is
    recorded here rather than papered over (adversary review, 2026-09-23).**
    It was adopted because one projected book could not be the worst case
    for three disagreeing consumers: the daily-loss numerator, the
    volatility-relative threshold, and gross exposure. The owner's removal
    of the account-level loss halt (PR #584) deleted the first two. The
    survivor, `_entry_deployment_budget`, turns out to be cheaply boundable
    in both of its regimes: with `allow_margin: true` — what ships — it
    returns `ceiling_x * equity - held_gross` and never reads cash, a COVER
    lowers held gross, so simply NOT applying any cover is already the
    minimum headroom; with margin off it returns `min(headroom, cash)` and
    both terms are monotone in the set of covers assumed, so the lower
    bound over every fill outcome is `min(headroom with no covers, cash
    with all covers)` — two scalars, no enumeration.

    The refusal is kept anyway, and on one ground only: it is strictly the
    more conservative posture, `execution.rotation_ranked_margin_enabled`
    ships FALSE, and loosening a live-selling gate is not something to do
    in the same change that resolves a merge. Whoever turns the flag on
    should take the bound above instead of inheriting this. What must NOT
    be inherited is the old justification, which claimed the bound was
    impossible; it is not, and saying so kept a refusal standing on a
    reason that no longer exists.

    So today the desk does not guess: a rotation is refused outright on any
    session with a cover pending. That costs a rotation on cover days and
    fails toward not trading, which is the direction every other guard on
    this path fails in.

    """Board item 39 — may this RANKED-MARGIN rotation close be submitted?

    Returns `None` for any SELL that is not a ranked-margin rotation close;
    every pre-item-39 path lands there and is unaffected. Otherwise returns
    `(cleared, positions, total_value, cash)`, with a REFRESHED book the
    caller must adopt — clearing the gate against a fresh book while the
    loop then sizes and prices off a stale one would reintroduce, one
    statement later, exactly the divergence `_projected_sale_qty` exists to
    prevent.

    **Why it lives inside the SELL loop rather than ahead of it.** The
    rotation's close is ordered last (`_rotation_sell_last`), so by the
    time this runs every other SELL this session has been submitted and
    waited on to a terminal status. Re-reading the account here therefore
    MEASURES what those did instead of assuming it.

    COVERs are the exception: their loop runs AFTER this one, so no cover
    has happened, none can be measured, and — see `_pending_cover_symbols`
    — none can honestly be bounded either. A session with a cover pending
    refuses the rotation outright.

    An earlier version ran ahead of the whole loop and projected the other
    exits too, bounding the uncertainty by evaluating two books ("all exits
    fill" and "only this one fills"). That is not a bound — the worst case
    is per-position and is neither book — and it also put this gate in
    direct conflict with `apply_gross_ceiling`, which nets out EVERY
    planned exit when it sizes the replacement. Measuring removes both
    problems.

    `cleared=False` means: do not submit this close. The replacement BUY
    then dies on the existing `_drop_rotation_buy_if_room_not_freed` path,
    because `rotation["sell_order_id"]` is never set — the room it was
    granted was never freed. Both legs fall together and the desk simply
    keeps the position.

    Scope: the RANKED-MARGIN tier only. The categorical tier
    (`ineligible_hold`, already live) sells a holding that fails the desk's
    own entry rules today — on that ground alone. OWNER RULING 2026-10-01
    removed the broken-protection conjunct: a name may now be cut with its
    structural protection still intact, because a position that would not
    be bought today has to earn its place regardless of where its stop is.
    The protection state is still measured, still carried in the sale's
    reason and still said to the owner; it no longer vetoes. That sale
    stands on its own and nothing here touches it.
