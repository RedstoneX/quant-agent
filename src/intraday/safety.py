        Fill reconcile, stop-out reconcile, protection-restore drain and
        repeg drain cost no model spend and protect live capital. Until
        2026-10-01 they existed ONLY as the opening block of
        ``_run_intra_check_body``, so they were welded to the *paid*
        intraday tick: cutting the paid cadence would silently have cut
        the loss-protection latency with it. That coupling was the defect
        item 177 names.

        The body is unchanged and lives in ``_run_intra_safety_preamble``.
        Both entry points call that one method, so this is strictly
        ADDITIVE: the paid tick still runs the preamble exactly as before,
        and the standalone ``intra_safety`` mode gives it a second,
        independent chance every tick. There is no new window in which
        protection is not restored — the only change is that one more
        caller can reach the same idempotent work.

        Both callers take the same advisory ``_intraday_scan_process_lock``
        and the same ``_blocking_owner_session`` check (board item 127), so
        two of them firing together cannot race: whichever acquires the
        lock does the work and the other defers, which is the behaviour the
        lock was built for.

        No LLM calls, and deliberately NO cost session — this path can
        never spend, and activating one would put empty rows into the very
        ``llm_budget_sessions`` measurement item 177 reads.
