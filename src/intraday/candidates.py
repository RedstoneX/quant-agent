        the three everyday reasons a tick adds no new activity from EACH

        visible as "intraday_scan_crashed" but left these three still

            wrapper that still holds the owner lock at the end of this
            tick's wait (`_await_paid_scan_slot`).

            INTRADAY look (item 121; see `_intraday_open_overlap_skip`).
          - "intraday_scan_no_opportunity": the scan ran and found nothing
            worth escalating (see `_intraday_opportunity_scan_body`'s
            early-return points).
