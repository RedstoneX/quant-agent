"""src.intraday.trend_exit_tick -- the trend exit, once per session at the first 30-minute check, on DAILY closes.

Owner ruling 2026-10-09 21:02 ET (final): the trend exit (sell on a confirmed
break of the last rising low; `src/exits/alignment_exit.py`) acts ONCE a day,
at the first 30-minute check after the open, on DAILY closes -- never
intraday bars. Later checks that session only RETRY a holding whose sale
FAILED (`error`) or was PUT OFF (`deferred`).

This module adds NO exit maths, NO number and NO sell door:
  * the verdict is the review's own memoised one (`_alignment_exit_cached`),
    read on the price feed's COMPLETED daily bars (`MarketData.get_ohlcv`
    drops today's unfinished bar in market hours; nothing intraday is read),
    so in session the newest bar read is the PRIOR session's close;
  * a cleared verdict is executed by the review's OWN guarded executor
    (`_midday_execute_llm_actions`, with no model review) -- its alignment
    scan re-raises the sale from the same memoised verdict and every gate it
    applies to a review-raised sale applies here unchanged: same-day trim,
    spent trigger, exit veto, AI Risk objection list, share-count sign, and
    the fallback that restores a displaced action on refusal. No AI seat is
    called: the review's AI Risk call happens before that executor and only
    sees the model's own exits, so a scan-raised sale never reaches it.

What this adds is WHEN it runs. The pass is keyed on the SESSION date (the ET
trading date of the tick), persisted per holding (`trend_exit_tick_checks`;
its `bar_date` column holds that session key):
  * a tick OUTSIDE regular hours (the 16:00 ET tick, any off-hours run) does
    no trend work at all -- it would read a just-closed, possibly not final
    bar, could sell at/after the close, and would use up the next morning's
    pass;
  * the first in-session tick with no marker for this session runs the pass
    (normally 09:30 ET; if that tick is missed, the next in-session tick runs
    it instead);
  * later ticks that session retry ONLY `deferred` (a working order was in
    the way, or the order listing was unreadable) and `error` (the sell path
    raised). A plain refusal (`refused`: a gate, veto or objection said no)
    is a decision, not a failure, and is not retried; `refused_final`
    (bought today, already cut today) is not retried either. There is no
    retry cap: retries are bounded by the session's remaining ticks.

Overlap with a running review (the tick is exempt from the session lock, and
that lock lapses): a holding with ANY working non-stop order at the broker is
not routed to the sell path; it is marked `deferred`, still trailed, and
retried next tick. An unreadable order listing defers every firing holding
(fail closed).

An exception from the sell path may come AFTER an order went out, so every
firing holding is marked `error`, kept out of this tick's trail, and the
failure is recorded durably; the retry next tick passes the open-order check
first.
