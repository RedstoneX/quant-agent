        Yields True when this process holds the lock, False otherwise.

        Why (independent review finding, 2026-08-19): the owner-lock
        `_another_session_recently_active` guard sees a concurrent
        morning/midday/close only while that wrapper still owns the
        process. Two `intra_check` processes launched at nearly the same
        instant would both pass it — and could then size BUYs against the
        same pre-fill snapshot, breaching `max_position_pct`.

        In practice `scripts/run_if_et_window.sh` makes that impossible:
        ticks are 1800s apart and the wrapper hard-kills a run at
        `timeout --kill-after=30 1200` (~1230s), so a tick is always dead
        before the next fires. But that guarantee lives in a deployment
        config this code cannot read (the production systemd units are not
        in-repo), and it would silently disappear if the interval were ever
        shortened. A trading safety property should not depend on an
        unverifiable assumption, so this closes the class outright.

        Deliberately NOT a new service/daemon/timer — a plain advisory
        `flock` on a local file, the same idea as the wrapper's existing
        `mkdir`-based session lock. Since 2026-09-19 (board item 127) it
        also guards `intra_check`'s broker-writing preamble, and the
        standalone coverage sweep's repair pass takes the same file
        (`src.coverage_watchdog.repair_lock`). Loss protection keeps its
        exemption and never touches this. The lock is released on process exit even if we
        are SIGKILLed, so a killed run cannot wedge it.
