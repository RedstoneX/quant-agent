"""Phase 9 §9.5 — the conviction ledger: who took which side, and what it cost.

`docs/QAMC_REMEDIATION_SPEC.md` §9.5 asks for "who nominated it, who
confirmed, who dissented and on what grounds". §9.1/§9.2 already record the
first half: every raw nomination is persisted as a `pipeline_event` evidence
row carrying seat, conviction and observation. What was missing was the other
three quarters — the JOIN from a nomination to the decision and trade it
became, an explicit record of the seats that argued the OTHER way, and any
scoring of either against a realized outcome.

This module is the pure-logic half of that, and pure logic ONLY: no I/O, no
DB handle, no LLM calls, no broker access. Same posture and same reason as
`src/nominations.py` — the scoring and aggregation rules are the part worth
testing, and they should be testable without constructing a `Database` or a
`TradingPipeline`. The persistence side lives on `Database`
(`record_seat_stances`, `resolve_conviction_ledger`, `get_conviction_credits`).

**Advisory only.** Nothing here is read by the trading decision chain. No
function in this module is called from sizing, risk allocation, or order
construction, and none of them may become so without a separate ratified
decision — the spec is explicit that the ledger exists to make the desk
legible to the operator, not to change what the desk trades.

Five ideas:

**A stance is a side taken.** A seat that rated a symbol bullish while the
desk went long SUPPORTED the trade; one that rated it bearish OPPOSED it. A
neutral seat took no side and is not scored — crediting "no view" either way
would let a seat accumulate a record by abstaining. Alignment is decided by
`src/risk/rules.py::stance_is_aligned`, the same vocabulary the §9.4
agreement ceiling and `validate_grounding` already share; a second, divergent
notion of "aligned" here would let the ledger and the sizing gate disagree
about identical evidence.

**Credit is raw signed R. Nothing weights it.** A supporter of a trade that
made +2R scores +2R; an opposer of that same trade scores -2R. If the trade
had instead lost 1R, the opposer would score +1R — being right to argue
against a loser is the whole point of recording dissent. `r_multiple`
(`src/risk/metrics.py`) is the measure: profit in units of the risk originally
taken, against the stop the position was OPENED with.

This reverses an earlier design in which credit was multiplied by the seat's
own declared conviction (high 1.0 / medium 0.6 / low 0.3). **Owner decision,
2026-08-31**, for two reasons that live here so nobody reinstates the weight:

1. **It is circular.** The ledger exists to discover whether an analyst's
   declared confidence predicts anything. Multiplying its credit by its own
   confidence assumes that answer and bakes it into the measurement. This desk
   has already seen high-conviction trades underperform low-conviction ones at
   small sample (see `_CONVICTION_OUTCOME_MIN_N` in `src/storage/db.py`);
   under weighting that finding would have been hidden inside the score.
2. **It double-counts.** A confident call already earns a larger position
   through the §9.4 agreement ceiling, and a larger position already produces
   a proportionally larger R. Weighting the credit again charges confidence a
   second time for the same fact.

A confidence weight could legitimately be introduced later — but only one
DERIVED from an analyst's own measured history, never one chosen up front.
Deriving it needs the breakdown below to exist first, which is the point of it.

**Confidence is reported, not applied.** The declared conviction is still
recorded on every credit row; it simply stops multiplying anything. Instead,
`aggregate_seat_records` breaks each analyst's record down BY the confidence
it declared (`SeatRecord.by_confidence`): resolved calls, calls right, average
win, average loss and cumulative total, separately for each level that analyst
used. "Does this analyst's high confidence earn more?" becomes something a
reader can see, rather than something this module asserts.

**Direction is arithmetic, never sign convention.** A short is scored exactly
as a long is. A short that made money is a WIN and a POSITIVE number; a short
that lost money is a LOSS and a NEGATIVE number; an analyst that argued FOR a
profitable short is credited and one that argued AGAINST it is charged —
identically to a long. Direction changes only how profit is computed from
prices (`r_multiple` takes the side from a signed qty), never the sign of a
credit, never the wording, never which side of zero anything lands on. Nothing
here — or anywhere a human reads this output — inverts, negates or
special-cases a short. **Owner decision, 2026-08-31.**

**No thresholds.** `aggregate_seat_records` returns raw counts and raw
averages with no minimum-sample gate, deliberately. Owner decision: return
the numbers and let the reader judge whether four resolved calls mean
anything, rather than hiding them behind a threshold this desk has no
evidence for.
