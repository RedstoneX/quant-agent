    """Count how many CONSECUTIVE prior trading-day closes confirm a break,
    walking back from the most recent completed session.

    Fixes two cross-day confirmation defects in the raw-streak approach:

      - ADJACENCY (#3). `prior_session_dates` is the exact sequence of
        completed trading sessions strictly before today's close, most-recent
        first, taken from the position's own daily bars (the authoritative
        trading calendar — it already skips weekends and holidays). A prior
        broken close counts toward the streak ONLY if it sits on the session
        immediately preceding the last-counted one. A session with no stored
        read, or a stored read that is not broken, ENDS the streak — so a gap
        (Friday's break then the following Friday's, with the week between
        never confirming) can never chain into a false confirmation.

      - MARGIN CONFLATION (#4). `clears(record)` decides whether that day's
        stored close cleared the margin IN FORCE UNDER TODAY's classification
        — not merely whether it was flagged broken at the time under whatever
        (possibly looser) margin then applied. A close that only cleared a
        looser margin does not count.

    Pure: it reads the records the caller supplies and returns a count. Returns
    0 when the caller supplies no records/sessions (the caller then falls back
    to the legacy boolean shorthand).

    Exact same matching rule as
    `PortfolioConstructor._level_backing_stop` (side-correctness relative
    to entry, `min_level_touches` prior touches, closest level whose own
    ZONE contains the stop) — reimplemented here as a free function, over
    the same plain data, because that method lives on a class this module
    must not import (it would be a risk module depending on the
    constructor, backwards from every other dependency in this codebase)
    and because the bars it reads off `self.cfg` are passed in here
    directly by the caller instead. Any behavioural drift between the two
    would be a bug; there is deliberately only one set of numbers (the
    caller's), never a second one invented here.

    `level_cluster_tolerance_pct` is NOT a knob. It is
    `src.data.levels.CLUSTER_TOLERANCE_PCT`, the constant
    `find_structural_levels` used to build these zones, passed in rather
    than imported only because this module is deliberately stdlib-only.
    Every caller must pass exactly that; `tests/test_level_match_zone.py`
    checks that they all do. Until 2026-09-13 this was an ATR multiple
    (`level_match_atr_tolerance`, 0.25) claiming to be "at least as wide"
    as the 1% zone — a claim in a different unit that only held above 4%
    ATR — see docs/WORK.md item 46 / docs/INCIDENT_HISTORY.md.
