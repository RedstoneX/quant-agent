"""Deterministic guard on exit reasoning — spec Phase 3.2, audit §1.5.

The Position Reviewer had no memory of its own prior review. It rebuilt its
view of every position from scratch twice a day, so it could report a position
deteriorating while every number it had itself recorded six hours earlier had
improved. On 2026-08-26 it sold EPD for "not progressing" when thesis progress
had risen 16% -> 20% and distance-to-stop had improved since its own midday
read. The evening reviewer then graded that exit **premature**, and the same
thing happened to MRVL.

This module is the deterministic half of the fix. It does not decide anything
about the market; it only refuses to let a **deterioration claim** stand when
the deterioration did not happen. The reviewer keeps full authority to exit on
new information — adverse news, an earnings miss, a regime shift, a
correlation breach, a triggered `thesis_invalid_if`. Those are judgments about
the world. "It is stalling" is a claim about numbers, and the numbers are
right here.

Directionality matters and is the whole point:
  - `thesis_progress_pct` rising is improvement.
  - `distance_to_stop_pct` rising is improvement (further from the stop).
  - `r_multiple` rising is improvement.
  - `pace` rising is improvement.
A verdict may not call a position stalled while its own measured deltas are
positive.
