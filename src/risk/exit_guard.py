"""Deterministic guard on exit reasoning — spec Phase 3.2, audit §1.5.

The Position Reviewer had no memory of its own prior review. It rebuilt its
view of every position from scratch twice a day, so it could report a position
deteriorating while every number it had itself recorded six hours earlier had
improved. On 2026-08-26 it sold EPD for "not progressing" when thesis progress
had risen 16% -> 20% and distance-to-stop had improved since its own midday
read. The evening reviewer then graded that exit **premature**, and the same
thing happened to MRVL.

This module is the deterministic half of the fix. It does not decide anything
about the market; it only refuses to let a **deterioration claim** stand when
the deterioration did not happen. The reviewer keeps full authority to exit on
new information — adverse news, an earnings miss, a regime shift, a
triggered `thesis_invalid_if`. Those are judgments about
the world. "It is stalling" is a claim about numbers, and the numbers are
right here.

Directionality matters and is the whole point:
  - `thesis_progress_pct` rising is improvement.
  - `distance_to_stop_pct` rising is improvement ONLY when the PRICE moved
    away from the stop, on EITHER side — see `veto_contradicted_exit`'s
    docstring for the 2026-09-18 fix that made the underlying metric
    actually side-correct for a short. It is also a function of the stop
    as much as of the price, so widening the stop also makes it rise —
    which is the desk removing its own protection, not the position
    getting better. Verified on real 2026-09-01 snapshots for V, CMCSA and
    DIS, all three of which were deteriorating at the time. Decomposed
    since 2026-09-18; see `_STOP_DEPENDENT_METRIC` and
    `MetricDeltas.stop_driven`, both side-aware since the same date.
  - `r_multiple` rising is improvement.
  - `pace` rising is improvement.
A verdict may not call a position stalled while its own measured deltas are
positive.

#: BOARD ITEM 70, THE SPLIT (2026-09-26). Until this date ONE literal `1.0`
#: did TWO different jobs in the exit path: the noise band (removed 2026-10-09; how far an
#: adverse move must travel from ENTRY before it stops being ordinary daily
#: wobble) and the BREAK MARGIN below (how far a daily CLOSE must sit beyond a
#: structural LEVEL before that level counts as broken). They are not the same
#: quantity — different reference points, different units in the literature,
#: and nothing ties their magnitudes — so a shared constant made each one
#: impossible to source without moving the other. They are now two names.
#:
#: NO BEHAVIOUR CHANGES IN THIS SPLIT. Both are 1.0 today, exactly as before;
#: the split exists so each can be answered on its own evidence. Neither value
#: was retuned, which item 70 explicitly forbids in the same pass.
#:
#: WHAT THE RESEARCH FOUND for THIS one (docs/INCIDENT_HISTORY.md, 2026-09-26).
#: The published literature answers "how far beyond a level is a real break" in
#: PERCENT and level-dependently, never in ATRs: Edwards & Magee use ~3% for a
#: major level and ~1% for a short-term one; Bulkowski's answer is essentially
#: "a decisive close", i.e. zero distance, with confirmation carried by the
#: close count and the throwback behaviour instead. There is therefore NO
#: published ATR basis for this quantity at all — it is not merely unsourced,
#: it is unidentifiable in the units it is expressed in. The confirmation RULE
#: around it IS sourced (`TREND_CONFIRMING_CLOSES`, Edwards & Magee's two
#: consecutive closes); only this margin is not. Kept at 1.0 and kept
#: `arbitrary` in config/number_ledger.yaml rather than dressed up as sourced.
BREAK_CONFIRMATION_ATR_MULTIPLE = 1.0

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Structural (data-driven) holding protection — spec item 25, 2026-09-03
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# WHAT THIS REPLACES. `holding_discipline_false_claim` used to treat every
# position with `days_held < 5` as "protected" from a plain SELL/REDUCE/COVER,
# full stop — a flat day-count with no backtest behind it, traced to an April
# 2026 commit that stated a philosophy ("give a thesis room to work") and
# never measured one. The owner rejected the day count as arbitrary and
# approved this replacement: a position is protected from a plain
# no-real-trigger exit UNLESS the structural level actually backing its
# thesis has been broken by price. Nothing here is time-bound; a position
# held 30 days with an intact level is exactly as protected as one held
# zero days with the same level intact, and a position whose level breaks
# on day zero has no protection at all.
#
# WHAT "backing its thesis" MEANS, in priority order:
#   1. The trade's own `thesis_invalid_if` (the analyst's stated falsifier,
#      `TradeDecision.thesis_invalid_if` — PR #250), checked for real against
#      today's price/MA data via `check_thesis_invalid_if` above. TRIGGERED
#      means broken; NOT_TRIGGERED means intact; UNPARSEABLE falls through
#      to (2) rather than being treated as either — an unparseable condition
#      is not evidence either way, and a fallback the desk already trusts
#      elsewhere is a better answer than a coin flip.
#   2. Absent a stated condition (or given one `check_thesis_invalid_if`
#      cannot read), the nearest VERIFIED structural level backing the
#      position's actual stop — the exact machinery
#      `PortfolioConstructor._level_backing_stop` already uses to decide
#      whether a stop earns an exemption from the ATR noise floor:
#      `computed_levels` / `computed_level_touches` (real levels, attached
#      to the analysis in Python by `TechAnalystAgent`, never asserted by
#      the model — see that method's docstring), gated on
#      `min_level_touches` prior touches (the already-ratified
#      `min_level_touches_for_stop_honor` bar, docs/RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md
#      §7), matched to the stop by whether the stop falls inside that
#      level's own zone (`level_cluster_tolerance_pct` of the level price
#      — `src.data.levels.CLUSTER_TOLERANCE_PCT`, the constant that built
#      the zone). No new constant is introduced here — both bars are the
#      ones `_level_backing_stop` already uses, reused rather than
#      duplicated. A long's level is "broken" when price is at or through
#      it by more than one ATR noise band (a different question in a
#      different unit — see `check_structural_protection`'s docstring);
#      the mirror for a short is price at or through a resistance level
#      from above.
#   3. Neither (1) nor (2) resolves — no stated condition (or an
#      unparseable one) AND no qualifying structural level under the stop.
#      This is an INTENTIONAL, owner-flagged behaviour change: a thesis
#      with nothing concrete backing it is not entitled to an automatic
#      pass just because it is young. The caller must log this case
#      visibly (see `holding_discipline_false_claim` below) rather than
#      silently letting the position fall through as either protected or
#      not.
#
# This module never fetches data itself — every value is a plain number,
# string or mapping the caller already has lying around from the same
# machinery `PortfolioConstructor` uses (bars → `compute_indicators` →
# atr/MAs, `find_structural_levels` → computed_levels/touches). No LLM call
# anywhere in this path.

    TREND-SCALED CONFIRMATION (owner mandate 2026-09-24; citation-backed spec).
    `adx`, the 50/200 MA stack and the 200-MA SLOPE (`ma_200`/`ma_200_prior`)
    and the close are passed to `classify_trend_context`, which selects one of
    two sourced regimes (see the module note above): the DEFAULT regime
    (against/weak/tangled, or no trend data) uses the ratified two-consecutive-
    close floor with reclaim reset; the STRONG-WITH-TREND regime (ADX>=25 with a
    rising-200/50>200 up-structure) additionally requires the prior structural
    swing-low to also break before lifting protection. There is NO single-close
    path — nothing exits faster than the two-close floor. The break MARGIN is
    ALWAYS `BREAK_CONFIRMATION_ATR_MULTIPLE` (1.0 ATR) — the regime changes only whether
    the prior-low condition applies, never the margin or the close count. The
    decisive outcomes (a confirmed break, or a break held pending confirmation)
    fill `owner_reason` with a plain-language sentence for the owner surfaces.

    CONFIRMATION STATE carried across days. Preferred inputs are
    `prior_break_records` — one record per prior completed session for this
    position (each `{bar_date, raw_broken, close}`) — and `prior_session_dates`
    — the exact completed trading sessions strictly before today's close,
    most-recent first, taken from the position's own daily bars (the
    authoritative calendar, weekends/holidays already removed). From those the
    count of CONSECUTIVE confirming prior closes is reconstructed here, so a
    skipped/gap session resets the streak (#3) and a prior close that only
    cleared a LOOSER margin than today's classification demands does not count
    (#4). When those richer inputs are absent, the legacy shorthands apply:
    `prior_break_streak` (an int count) or `break_seen_prior_close` (a bool,
    a prior streak of exactly one).

    `current_price` MUST be the latest completed DAILY CLOSE for the
    thesis/level basis below — never a live/intraday quote. Real trading
    practice (and this codebase's own noise-band reasoning elsewhere) is
    explicit that a level "breaks" on a decisive close beyond it, not on a
    wick that pierces it and closes back inside; a same-day intrabar dip
    through a level must never register as a break at all, closed or not.
    `ma_20`/`ma_50`/`ma_200` must be computed off the same close.

    CONFIRMATION GATE (owner refinement, 2026-09-04, corrected same day
    after review against real technical-analysis practice). A thesis-break
    or a structural-level break must not lift protection off a single
    day's close — a "spring" (a level briefly breaking then reclaiming,
    often itself a BULLISH signal) is a well-documented pattern, not a
    real breakdown, and can take a day or two to resolve. A break lifts
    protection only once the SAME break condition holds on the close of
    TWO CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAYS. `break_seen_prior_close` carries that
    state IN — true when the immediately preceding TRADING DAY's close
    (not merely the last time this ran — several same-day pipeline cycles
    must not double-count one close), for this same position, already
    came back `raw_broken=True`. This read only lifts protection
    (`protected=False`) when it is ALSO broken today, i.e. two consecutive
    confirming closes; a single broken close returns `protected=True` with
    a `*_pending_confirmation` basis, and a reclaim the next day resets —
    it does NOT carry forward toward a future confirmation. The caller is
    responsible for persisting `raw_broken` keyed by symbol AND the close's
    own date, and feeding the prior TRADING DAY's value back in as
    `break_seen_prior_close`; this module holds no state of its own and
    does not know what a "day" or a "cycle" is. This gate applies ONLY to
    the thesis/level basis below — the no-level case (never protected), and
    the two independent regime-flip / bearish-state-change triggers in
    `holding_discipline_false_claim`, all lift protection immediately,
    unaffected by this gate.

    The margin for "beyond the level" is `BREAK_CONFIRMATION_ATR_MULTIPLE`
    (1.0), NOT the level-zone tolerance used to MATCH a level to a stop's
    placement. Until 2026-09-26 it shared the noise-band constant and this
    docstring called that 1.0 "already ratified" — it never was, on either
    job (board item 70); the two jobs now have two names and two ledger
    entries, both still open. The two are not
    even the same kind of quantity: matching is an identity question about
    a zone defined as a percentage of price, breaking is a question about
    whether a move exceeded the name's own noise, which is an ATR
    question. See docs/WORK.md item 46 for why conflating the two units
    was the defect here in the first place.

    the break is only pending confirmation (protected).

    Thin bool wrapper over `check_structural_protection` — see that
    function and the module note above for the full priority order and the
    confirmation gate. Kept as a separate function because most callers
    only need the yes/no answer; the caller that needs to log WHY, or that
    needs `raw_broken` to persist for the next cycle's
    `break_seen_prior_close` (see `holding_discipline_false_claim`), should
    call `check_structural_protection` directly.
