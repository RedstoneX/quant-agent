#: §9.4 freshness. An earnings stance older than this many days stops
#: COUNTING toward the agreement tally (it is still shown to the PM, and
#: still valid provenance — see `PortfolioManagerAgent.stale_evidence_sources`).
#:
#: Also (2026-09-02) the bound `EarningsDataProvider._get_existing_analysis`
#: (`src/data/earnings.py`) uses to decide whether a disk-cached analysis is
#: even eligible to be re-served as the CURRENT earnings view when no fresher
#: SEC filing exists — past this age that fallback returns None instead, so
#: an over-age analysis never reaches a session in the first place. That is a
#: stricter, earlier check than `stale_evidence_sources` above: this one
#: decides whether a stance is shown at all, that one decides whether a
#: stance that IS shown gets to count. Same threshold, so the two can never
#: disagree about what "too old" means.
#:
#: 90 is not a new number. `config/prompts/earnings_analyst.md` already tells
#: the seat that a filing more than 90 days old must cap its own `conviction`
#: at `low` and flag `stale_filing_<N>d`, and that past 180 days the filing
#: "should not have reached you"; `TradingPipeline._missed_ops_earnings_signal`
#: already refuses anything older than 90 days as "recent earnings evidence".
#: The seat and the reflector had a threshold; only the SIZING path did not
#: read it. Reusing 90 makes the sizing path agree with the opinion the desk
#: had already written down, rather than adding a fourth staleness rule.
EARNINGS_STANCE_MAX_AGE_DAYS = 90


#: §9.4 signed sum. Every seat enters the score at UNIT magnitude — +1 when it
#: is aligned with the proposed direction, -1 when it is opposed, 0 when it is
#: neutral or silent. Equal weighting is not a placeholder for a better number:
#: it is what published composite-index construction literally does, and what
#: Grinold & Kahn's `alpha = volatility x IC x score` reduces to when per-source
#: skill is equal.
#:
#: **Do not replace this with a per-seat weight table.** `src/conviction_ledger.py`
#: records the desk's standing rule (owner, 2026-08-31): a confidence weight may
#: only be DERIVED from an analyst's own measured history, never chosen up front,
#: and `_CONVICTION_OUTCOME_MIN_N` (`src/storage/db.py`) puts the minimum sample
#: at 20 resolved calls. The book has 7 closed equity round-trips, all carrying
#: conviction NULL — there is no sample to derive from, so any weight introduced
#: today would be a chosen one. `tests/test_signed_dissent.py` enforces this
#: mechanically rather than by memory.

    `non_corroborating_sources` (board item 109, 2026-09-26) is the ONE-SIDED
    removal: a seat named here may not CORROBORATE the trade, but its dissent
    still counts against it. `ignored_sources` stays two-sided ("a stance too
    stale to corroborate is too stale to dissent"). The two are separate
    parameters, not one merged set, because they are separate facts with
    separate consequences, and merging them silently turned this score's one
    guarantee — that gating a stance can only ever pull the net DOWN — into a
    falsehood: dropping an OPPOSED seat RAISES the net, and a name at net 0
    (refused) becomes net +1 (traded). A fix for a double count must not
    admit trades the desk refuses today, so the broadcast-macro exclusion is
    one-sided. See `PortfolioManagerAgent.broadcast_macro_sources` for why
    that is the right side to take it off.

    `S = sum(s_i)` over the five evidence seats, where `s_i` is `+SEAT_WEIGHT`
    for a seat pointing the way `direction` proposes, `-SEAT_WEIGHT` for one
    pointing the other way, and 0 for a seat that is neutral or absent.

    Expressed as the DIFFERENCE of the two counts rather than as a second
    traversal, on purpose: the aligned and opposed counts are what the PM is
    shown and what the order note records, so the number that sizes the trade
    is arithmetically the same number the reader was given. A second walk over
    `sources` here would be a second definition of "aligned" — the exact defect
    `stance_is_aligned`'s one-vocabulary comment exists to prevent.

    WHAT THIS REPLACED (2026-09-02). §9.4 used to ceiling size on the aligned
    count alone, so a seat that stayed SILENT, a seat that rated NEUTRAL and a
    seat that ACTIVELY DISAGREED all contributed exactly zero. `three aligned`
    and `three aligned, one against` bought identical size. No published
    composite methodology counts only agreers: a disagreeing input enters a
    composite as a negative number in a signed sum, and that is what this is.
