# thesis_invalid_if checker — measured, not assumed
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# `thesis_invalid_if` is free text an analyst writes at entry (e.g. "closes
# below the 50-day average", "loses the $142 level", "RSI drops below 30").
# Until now NOTHING checked whether it had actually become true when a SELL
# was later proposed citing it — pure honour system.
#
# General-purpose parsing of arbitrary English into an executable check was
# floated as too large/unreliable to attempt. Rather than accept that as a
# guess, it was measured against real recorded text: 20 real executed BUYs
# carrying an `(invalid if: ...)` / `(thesis_invalid_if: ...)` marker in
# `trades.reasoning`, plus 1,028 unique real, un-truncated
# `thesis_invalid_if` values recorded in `specialist_evidence` (tech-analyst
# candidates, 1,203 non-null occurrences before de-duplication) — see
# `docs/WORK.md` for the query and full bucket counts. Every one of those
# real values fell into exactly two checkable shapes:
#
#   - a moving-average reference ("closes below MA20", "the 50-day average")
#     — 984 of 1,028 unique specialist_evidence values (95.7%); every one of
#     the 20 real executed-trade examples that referenced an MA used MA20 or
#     MA50, never MA200 or any other period.
#   - a bare price level ("closes below the $218.51 support level", "loses
#     the $142 level") — 38 of 1,028 (3.7%).
#
# Everything else — a single Bollinger Band mention and a handful of
# qualitative conditions ("guidance pulled", "AI accelerator rollout faces
# delays") — was too rare (6 of 1,028, 0.6%) and, for the qualitative cases,
# inherently unparseable, to justify building or trusting a checker for. No
# RSI-threshold example was found in either real source at all, despite RSI
# thresholds being a plausible category in principle.
#
# So this checker covers ONLY the two shapes that are both common and safe:
# a bare numeric price level, and a moving-average reference where the
# caller already has the corresponding computed MA (20/50/200, matching
# `src/data/technical.py::compute_indicators` — no new indicator is computed
# here). It NEVER computes or fetches its own market data; the caller passes
# in whatever is already on hand from the same pipeline that would otherwise
# just trust the honour system.
#
# A compound condition ("closes below MA50 OR breaks $180 support") is
# deliberately refused (UNPARSEABLE) rather than partially evaluated: only
# unambiguous single conditions are checked. Same posture as the rest of
# this module — fail closed, only ever assert a fact that is provably true
# or provably false, never guess.
#
# NOT WIRED IN. This is a standalone, tested function. Wiring it into
# `RiskStage` or anywhere in the live pipeline is the next step, and is
# blocked on a parallel piece of work giving `thesis_invalid_if` its own
# dedicated, un-truncated field on `TradeDecision` — reading today's
# `reasoning`-embedded text here would mean trusting the same lossy,
# truncated string this whole effort exists to stop trusting.
