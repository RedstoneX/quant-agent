    `bars` are the daily bars SINCE ENTRY (the caller slices them); only those
    matter, because a swing low/high from before the position existed is not
    a level this trade ever defended.

    `qty` supplies only the SIDE — same convention as `risk.metrics.r_multiple`.
    A negative qty is a short: everything below mirrors across the entry
    price. A long's stop lives BELOW price and ratchets UP toward it as the
    trade works; a short's stop lives ABOVE price and ratchets DOWN toward it.
    Defaults to +1.0 so every existing (long-only) call site is unchanged.

    `initial_stop` is the stop AT ENTRY (before any trail ever moved it) —
    used only by the Type A breakeven ratchet (fix #3, see module docstring)
    to measure the risk actually taken. Optional and additive: omitting it
    (every pre-fix call site, until updated) simply means that ratchet never
    fires, reproducing the exact old behaviour.

    `structural_ceiling` is the constructor's MEASURED breakout verdict,
    pinned at entry (item 82, #649/#652). Passing it routes a measured
    breakout the analyst mislabelled "range" to Type B trailing instead of
    Type A — see `src.risk.constants.is_trend_trade`. `None` (the default,
    and every legacy row) falls back to the analyst's label alone, which is
