"""Seat agreement — spec §9.4 "agreement earns size".

Which evidence seats point with or against a proposed direction, and the
refusal rule on the net score. The signed score itself (`signed_source_score`),
`SEAT_WEIGHT` and `EARNINGS_STANCE_MAX_AGE_DAYS` stay in `src/risk/rules.py`:
the number ledger pins them there by module id.

Bodies moved VERBATIM from `src/risk/rules.py` (AST-identical to the
originals; `tests/test_risk_rules_parts_boundary.py` is the witness that this
part builds and runs alone). `src/risk/rules.py` keeps the engine, every
ledger-pinned number and the re-export mirror, so every existing
`from src.risk.rules import X` keeps resolving.

# --- Spec §9.4 "agreement earns size" -------------------------------------
#
# Since 2026-09-02 the quantity in play is a SIGNED SUM, not a headcount:
# `signed_source_score` nets opposed seats off aligned ones. Since
# 2026-09-14 it no longer earns SIZE at all — `agreement_refuses_trade`
# turns it into one yes/no refusal and nothing else (see that function for
# why the graduated ceiling was retired). The two counts below are still
# computed and still reported — a reader wants "2 for, 1 against", not only
# "net +1" — but neither of them sizes anything.
#
# Shared polarity vocabulary. `PortfolioManagerAgent.validate_grounding`
# (src/agents/portfolio_manager.py) uses this to decide whether a
# provenance claim's stance "supports" a target's direction; the
# constructor's agreement refusal (`src/portfolio_constructor.py`) uses the
# SAME rule to count how many of the canonical evidence registry's
# independent sources are directionally aligned with what the PM is
# actually proposing. One definition, two consumers, by design — a second,
# divergent notion of "aligned" here would let the ceiling and the
# grounding gate disagree about identical evidence.

    True for a signed source score at or below zero — a name with no net
    evidence for the direction proposed, or with net dissent against it. The
    caller maps that to `SizeOverride.no_trading()`: the target is dropped,
    no order is built, and anything already held is left exactly where it is
    (refusing to BUY is not a decision to SELL).

    False for any net score of 1 or more, and that is the WHOLE of what
    agreement does to size now. There is no rung, no ladder and no per-score
    number: a target that clears the refusal is bounded by the ratified
    per-trade envelope (`RiskConfig.max_position_risk_pct`) and by the
    portfolio budget allocator, exactly like every other target.

    **Why the graduated ceiling was retired (owner decision, 2026-09-14.)**
    Until this change §9.4 scaled permitted risk by the net seat count as
    `max_position_risk_pct x sqrt(n / 5)`. The square-root law is the
    statistics of averaging INDEPENDENT estimates, and this desk's seats are
    not independent: technical, news, earnings, macro and smart_money read
    overlapping evidence (the same tape, the same bars, the same filings)
    and several are the same underlying model behind different prompts. The
    archetype's one precondition is unmet, so the schedule could not be
    justified at any slope — and no honest correlation haircut exists to
    replace it with, only an invented number.

    Secondarily, a graduated ceiling cannot tell "the seats disagreed" from
    "the seats had nothing to look at". A thinly-covered name and a
    contested one arrive at the same low net score and were sized the same.
    That is the identical defect already fixed in the rotation rule (retired
    board item 66), and the refusal below is the only place the distinction
    is safe to act on: at or below zero the desk declines, and above zero it
    does not pretend to grade.

    What agreement still does, unchanged: it ORDERS which candidates get
    funded first, through `src/verdicts.py::rank_verdicts` and
    `allocate_risk_budget`'s `priority` (retired board item 49). Agreement
    earns the QUEUE POSITION. It no longer sets the size.
