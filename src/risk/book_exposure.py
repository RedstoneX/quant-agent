    `equity_history` is any iterable of past equity values (order irrelevant
    — a high-water mark does not care). `current_equity` is today's live
    equity and is included in the peak, so a book making new highs reads 0.0
    rather than a stale negative.

    This is the desk's only measure of drawdown. The rolling 5-day /
    20-day return brakes that used to sit beside it ("has our recent edge
    degraded, so halve new BUYs") were removed on 2026-09-20 by owner
    instruction; this one answers "how far are we off the high-water mark,
    so how much may the book own", and it sets the ceiling.

    Guard 2 (2026-09-02 operational safety guard): a NaN/inf equity reading
    can NEVER win the `max()` below and become the high-water mark. Another
    system's documented failure mode is an incremental "if new > hwm: hwm =
    new" tracker, where a single NaN reading poisons `hwm` permanently —
    every later comparison against NaN is False, so it never updates again
    and the breaker is silently disabled for good. This function structurally
    cannot do that: the peak is a fresh `max()` over a filtered list on
    EVERY call, never a variable carried between calls, so a bad reading on
    one call cannot contaminate the next. A non-finite entry is dropped
    before `max()` ever sees it (`math.isfinite` below) rather than being
    excluded by a comparison a NaN could silently fail.

    Guard 3 (2026-09-18): **an equity curve with no usable PRIOR reading is
    unmeasurable, not a zero drawdown.** Until this guard, a history that
    was empty — or whose every entry had been dropped as non-finite — left
    `current_equity` alone in the list, so it became its own high-water mark
    and the function returned a confident `0.0`. `resolve_gross_ceiling`
    reads `0.0` as "inside the no-de-levering band" and holds the loosest
    cap, which means a wiped or unreadable `daily_pnl` table silently
    disabled the desk's only automatic seller AND looked, in every log line
    and every owner-facing message, exactly like a book at record highs.
    Losing the data and making new highs are opposite states and must not
    produce the same output.

    The boundary is deliberately zero prior readings, not a chosen minimum
    number of days. Zero is the line between *measured* and *unmeasured* —
    it is not a number anyone picked, and this file's standing rule forbids
    inventing one. Whether a SHORT-but-non-empty curve (two or three days
    after a reset) is long enough to carry a meaningful high-water mark is a
    real, separate question with a real answer somewhere in the desk's own
    data; it is NOT answered here, and no `min_history=N` default is

# --- One definition of "how invested is the book" ------------------------

# THE DEFECT THIS REPLACES (measured 2026-09-01, two implementations run on
# one book): `$50k AAPL long + $20k SQQQ` against a 60% target, $100k equity.
#
#   PM was told   `total_value - cash`            -> 70% -> "10pp OVER target"
#   RM was told   `abs(sum(mv * signed_mult))`    -> 10% -> "50pp UNDER target,
#                                                            do NOT scale down"
#
# Same book, same target, opposite sign, and each seat acted on its own
# number. `book_exposure` is now the only place either question is answered.
#
# WHY `deployed_pct` IS THE ONE COMPARED TO THE INVESTED TARGET, and not
# the signed leverage-aware number:
#
#  1. The target is DEFINED as the complement of cash. It used to be macro's
#     `target_invested_pct` (0-100, "sums to ~100" with its cash number);
#     since the owner mandate of 2026-09-17 it is the fixed
#     `DESK_INVESTED_TARGET_PCT` below. Either way it is a capital-deployment
#     target.
#  2. The consequence the gap exists to fix is idle cash — PMFacts renders it
#     as "the single largest P&L drag (idle cash in a rising market)" and
#     routes it to the `cash_target` step. Leverage does not make a dollar
#     less idle: $20k in a 3x fund is $20k of cash put to work, not $60k.
#  3. The signed measure has no honest comparison to a 0-100 target. A book
#     fully deployed in a 3x inverse ETF reads -300%, i.e. "375pp under a 75%
#     target, deploy more" — with no cash to deploy. A long $50k / short $50k
#     book reads 0% and asks for more of the money it has already spent.
#  4. The leverage-and-direction question is ALREADY answered, deterministically
#     and ENFORCED rather than advised, by `gross_exposure` + the §11.2
#     `apply_gross_ceiling`. It does not need
#     `macro_exposure_deviation` to answer it a second time, badly.
#
# `deployed_usd` sums |market_value|, which also repairs a quieter defect in
# the PM's old `total_value - cash`: equity is `cash + sum(market_value)`, and
# a held short's `market_value` is NEGATIVE, so a short made the book look
# LESS deployed to the PM, which then deployed more. Shorting is capital put
# to work, not capital returned to the pile.
#
# `net_usd` is kept and REPORTED rather than discarded, and it carries no
# `abs()`. The old `abs(existing_net + pending)` made a net-SHORT book read as
# positively invested — long and short of the same size were literally the
# same number. A negative `net_pct` now says "net short" out loud.
#
# The cash-sweep vehicle is not exposure in ANY of the three, matching
# `gross_exposure`, `_force_delever` and every LLM-facing position view.
