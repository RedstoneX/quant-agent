"""The owner's minimum risk per position — ONE definition, every caller.

Owner rule 2026-08-27: risk per new position is 0.5-5% of equity, and below
the floor the desk does not trade. The floor's value is the setting
`risk.min_position_risk_pct` (`PortfolioConstructorConfig.min_risk_pct` in
the constructor); nothing here hard-codes it.

Reading of the rule (kept deliberately, owner rule 2026-08-27): the WHOLE
position after the order — held same-side size plus this order — must risk
at least the floor at its stop, not the order alone. An add that leaves the
position above the floor passes; a remnant whose whole position is under it
is refused.

Before this module the rule was computed three ways (constructor by weight,
execution by shares x stop distance, rotation by flat notional against
equity — which is only right for a 100% stop). Every caller now hands
`min_risk_shortfall` the same five facts and reads the same answer.
