# --- Triggers: what legitimises re-deriving -------------------------------

#: The level the target was measured against has been closed through by at
#: least one noise band, on two consecutive trading-day closes.
TRIGGER_LEVEL_BROKEN = "TARGET_LEVEL_BROKEN_CONFIRMED"

#: Today's ATR puts the stored target past `horizon_reach` for the pinned
#: horizon — the derivation would no longer accept it as reachable.
TRIGGER_TARGET_BEYOND_REACH = "TARGET_BEYOND_TODAYS_REACH"

#: Today's ATR puts the stored target inside the derivation's own noise
#: floor — it no longer clears the instrument's own daily range.
TRIGGER_TARGET_INSIDE_NOISE = "TARGET_INSIDE_TODAYS_NOISE_FLOOR"

#: A structural level still in the way now stands BETWEEN the entry and the
#: stored target — the target is aiming past a wall. See the module
#: docstring's trigger 3 for why this is the mirror of TRIGGER_LEVEL_BROKEN
#: and not a new kind of event.
TRIGGER_WALL_IN_FRONT_OF_TARGET = "STRUCTURAL_WALL_STANDING_IN_FRONT_OF_TARGET"

#: THE WAY IN (item 194). Recorded as the `seat` on every outcome that was
#: adjudicated because the position is open, not because a seat named it.
#: `src.models.TargetRevisionFlag` has exactly two fields, symbol and
#: evidence, and no price, so a seat flag supplies NO input to
#: `assess_target_revision` — every number it uses is recomputed from bars
#: or read off the ratified config. Gating the measurement on whether an
#: LLM happened to mention the symbol therefore does not make the write
#: safer; it only makes the coverage arbitrary. This label exists so the
#: record can always say which outcomes came from the unconditional sweep.
SEAT_STRUCTURAL_SWEEP = "structural_sweep"

#: The evidence string filed for a swept position. Deliberately states the
#: absence of a seat opinion rather than inventing one.

    "no seat raised this symbol; adjudicated because the position is open "
    "and its stored target is re-measured from the chart every session"
)

# --- Outcomes that are NOT a revision, each recorded by name --------------

#: The seat's flag was real but no structural event backs it. This is the
#: expected outcome for "the seat thinks there is more upside", and it is a
#: recorded refusal rather than a silent no-op.
REVISION_NO_TRIGGER = "REFUSAL_NO_STRUCTURAL_EVENT"

#: The target's level was closed through TODAY but not on the prior trading
#: day's close. Same one-day-spring guard as `check_structural_protection`.
REVISION_BREAK_PENDING_CONFIRMATION = "REFUSAL_BREAK_PENDING_CONFIRMATION"

#: Today's ATR puts the stored target outside the derivation's reach, but
#: the PRIOR trading day's close did not. Same gate, same mechanism and the
#: same stored state as the break above — see `raw_trigger_flags`.
REVISION_REACH_PENDING_CONFIRMATION = "REFUSAL_REACH_PENDING_CONFIRMATION"

#: A wall stands between entry and target on today's close but did not on
#: the prior trading day's. Same gate as the two above.
REVISION_WALL_PENDING_CONFIRMATION = "REFUSAL_WALL_PENDING_CONFIRMATION"

#: No `expected_horizon_sessions` on the trade row. Legacy rows predate the
#: pin; the horizon is never recomputed, so these can never be revised.
REVISION_NO_PINNED_HORIZON = "REFUSAL_NO_PINNED_HORIZON"

#: No usable take-profit on the row to revise in the first place.
REVISION_NO_STORED_TARGET = "REFUSAL_NO_STORED_TARGET"

#: Bars/indicators for the symbol could not be read, so the trigger tests
#: themselves cannot run. A DATA FAULT, not a judgement.
REVISION_UNMEASURABLE_INPUTS = "FAULT_NO_BARS_FOR_REVISION"

#: A trigger fired, the chart HAS structure, and the price has closed
#: decisively beyond all of it — nothing in the trade's direction is left to
#: measure against. Distinct from the derivation's REFUSAL_NO_STRUCTURE,
#: which asserts the history holds no level at all.
REVISION_NO_CEILING_LEFT = "REFUSAL_NO_STRUCTURE_LEFT_IN_DIRECTION"

#: A trigger fired and today's bars yield a target the price has already
#: passed. The old target stands — see the note at the check itself.
REVISION_BEHIND_PRICE = "REFUSAL_DERIVED_TARGET_BEHIND_PRICE"

#: A trigger fired and the re-derivation succeeded, but it landed on the
#: same price. Recorded so the flag is never a blank.
REVISION_NO_CHANGE = "NO_CHANGE_ON_REDERIVATION"

#: `TargetDerivation.basis` when the derivation picked a real structural
#: level rather than projecting a measured move. Mirrored from
#: `src.data.levels.derive_structural_target`, which writes the string
#: literally; `tests/test_target_revision.py` asserts the two still agree,
#: because the re-anchor below accepts ONLY this basis.
STRUCTURAL_LEVEL_BASIS = "structural_level"

#: The basis recorded when a target was re-derived with the reach anchored
#: on the latest completed close over the REMAINING horizon, after the
#: entry-anchored derivation had already refused as behind price. Distinct
#: from the plain `structural_level` on purpose: the record must say which
#: anchor produced the number, and a reader must be able to count these.

    the union of levels. And `derive_structural_target` partitions that
    union against the ENTRY price, so a broken overhead level is still
    "above entry" and would simply be picked again. Re-deriving without this
    filter returns the same number in exactly the motivating case: the
    ceiling is gone, and the derivation hands it back.

    The test applied is the SAME break test as `target_level_broken` — one
    `BREAK_CONFIRMATION_ATR_MULTIPLE` beyond the level on a completed daily close —
    applied to every level rather than only the one the target sat on. No
    new constant, and no second definition of "broken": a resistance the
    price has closed decisively above is not overhead any more, whichever
    level it happens to be.

    Degrades to the levels unchanged when the close or ATR is missing, so a

    PURE, and deliberately independent of the derivation so it can be

    through `levels_still_in_the_way`, because a level price has closed
    decisively beyond is not a wall any more and counting it would
    manufacture a finding out of a broken ceiling.

    `reference_price` is where the position is measured FROM, and every
    caller passes the ENTRY, not the current price — the same anchor the

    every position that has moved away from its entry, which is a
