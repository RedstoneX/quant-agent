Bodies moved VERBATIM from `src/risk/rules.py` (AST-identical to the

# --- Owner mandate 2026-09-25 — the ROLE-BASED conviction bar (R7) ---------
#
# "Earn the right to ENTER and to STAY." A name clears this bar only when a
# SUPPORTIVE seat carries a real, falsifiable reason AND no seat is opposed AND
# the chart is not fighting the trade. It is deliberately SEPARATE from
# `agreement_refuses_trade` (the §9.4 net-evidence floor) and from the
# continuous ranking score in `src/verdicts.py`: those grade and order, this
# one is a role-aware yes/no.
#
# WHY THIS INTRODUCES NO ARBITRARY NUMBER. The whole rule is counts, booleans
# and non-empty checks — "at least one" is existence, not a dial; "no seat
# opposed" is zero, not a chosen floor; the technical veto is a boolean. There
# is nothing here to ledger as `arbitrary` (contrast the discarded HIGH-count
# gate, which would have needed two owner-appetite numbers). The wider change
# carries no number at all: the STAY side culls a held name ONLY when a seat is
# ACTIVELY OPPOSED (owner ruling 2026-09-25), which is zero-versus-count, not a
# dial — there is no confirmation window and no streak.

#: Reasons these functions emit all start with this tag, the SAME string
#: `src.rotation.CONVICTION_BAR_REASON_PREFIX` matches on, so the STAY cull
#: (rotation's `ineligible_hold` tier) recognises exactly these reasons and
#: `holdings_below_entry_bar` counts them. A test pins the two equal.

    MECHANICAL DEFINITION, honest about what the seats actually emit

    Only Technical carries a machine-readable named invalidation LEVEL (a stop
    price); Earnings carries a genuine analyst-authored falsifier
    (`bear_case`/`bull_case`) or its verdict refuses to build; Macro carries a
    real trigger when the analyst stated one, else a generic fallback; News and

    is no distinct "has a named falsifier" boolean to read downstream — that
    distinction is lost when `to_verdict()` runs, and News/Smart-money can
    NEVER fail this check on specificity grounds since their invalidation is
    always synthesised. This is NOT a test for a genuinely specific or
    falsifiable thesis — it cannot tell a templated invalidation from an
    analyst-authored one. Requiring a NON-generic invalidation string would
    couple this gate to those exact template sentences, which rot.

    a DIRECTIONAL side (not a lukewarm neutral shrug), which
    `AnalystVerdict`'s own validator then FORCES to carry a non-empty
    invalidation condition AND at least one checkable evidence item. Technical

    tier). Pure: a function of the seat `AnalystVerdict`s for one name only.

         yes-vote: it must be PRESENT and CONFIRMING (aligned with the trade).
         A bearish technical read (chart hostile), a neutral one (chart not

         CONSERVATIVE choice: a name with no chart read this review does not get
         the benefit of the doubt on timing.
      2. NO name-level seat opposed (`_nontechnical_opposition_reason`). A
         news/earnings/smart-money seat pointing the other way fails the name
         outright. Macro is never a veto (owner mandate 2026-10-09): a

      3. At least one NON-technical seat took a SUPPORTED DIRECTIONAL side

         backed by evidence and an invalidation, not a bare neutral shrug.

         the one seat that holds a view on every name whether or not it
