    **One definition, two consumers, on purpose** (2026-09-11, docs/WORK.md

    of these, and they must not be able to drift apart:

      * whether any reward:risk comparison applies at all

      * whether `src/data/levels.py::derive_structural_target` may use its
        ATR measured-move projection instead of refusing for want of a level.

    Two independent ways to know it, and either is sufficient:

      * **The label.** The Technical Analyst typed `setup_type="breakout"`.
        This is the desk's existing Type A/B distinction and the same literal
        `src/risk/trailing.py` already branches on.
      * **The measurement.** `structural_ceiling=False` — the desk's OWN
        level computation found no structural level in the trade's direction
        of travel, on a chart that DID yield levels elsewhere. That is a
        computed fact about this specific trade, not an assertion about it,
        and it is strictly better evidence than the label.

    `structural_ceiling=None` means "not computed at this call site", not
    "no ceiling" — so a caller that cannot measure it falls back to the label
    alone, which is the conservative side.

    Why the measurement half exists: funnel item 6 ("no structural level from
    which to derive a target") refused real trades whose charts genuinely had
    nothing overhead, purely because the analyst had not separately typed the
    word "breakout" — while the correct ATR projection for exactly that case
    already existed in the code, reachable only through the label.

    **False for a Type B / breakout trade, and that is the whole rule**

    A breakout has no overhead level anyone is defending — `src/risk/
    trailing.py`'s module docstring is the desk's own statement of this, and
    the position is MANAGED accordingly: trailed from entry, with no fixed
    profit target at all. Any "reward" put in the numerator of a ratio for
    such a trade is therefore a number invented to satisfy the ratio, not a
    price the desk is trading toward. Gating on it, or sizing on it, judged
    the trade against a target its own exit management never intended to
    reach. Approval for a Type B trade rests on the RISK side alone: a real
    level-backed or ATR-derived stop, plus the multi-agent conviction and
    evidence checks that run regardless of setup type.

    True for a Type A / range trade, whose reward:risk IS real — measured
    from that specific trade's own support (risk) and resistance (reward).
    What is done with that number: ranking only — never a refusal and never
    a size cap. The 2026-10-01 parity refusal was deleted on 2026-10-09
    (owner mandate, docs/OUTCOME.md): measured that day, structural ceilings
    rejected price less often than a randomised control in both range and
    trend regimes (n~5,700), so the reward side is a forecast the desk never
    sells at. The stop and the risk caps bound the loss. An unmeasurable
    range payoff is a recorded fact / ranking hint.

    Fails to the conservative side: an unknown or missing setup type, with
    no measured ceiling fact supplied, keeps the reward:risk machinery on.

    `structural_ceiling` is the measured half — see `is_trend_trade`. A
    caller that has run the desk's own level computation for this trade can
    pass `False` when nothing sits in its direction of travel, and the
    exemption then rests on that fact rather than on the analyst's wording.
