# TREND-SCALED break confirmation

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A support/resistance break is confirmed by a decisive CLOSE beyond the level
# by the break margin (`BREAK_CONFIRMATION_ATR_MULTIPLE`, 1.0 ATR — the SAME margin for
# every regime, never a second ATR multiple), held over TWO consecutive closes
# with a reclaim in between resetting (the ratified spring floor). The owner
# mandate (2026-09-24) makes the desk MORE PATIENT only where a break is most
# likely a shakeout; it never lifts protection faster than that floor. Two
# regimes, both grounded, monotonic (nothing exits faster than the floor):
#
#   STRONG-WITH-TREND — a break WITH a strong uptrend (ADX>=25 AND price above a
#     RISING 200-day MA AND 50MA>200MA; short mirror): the shakeout-most-likely
#     case. Require the two-close floor AND that the PRIOR structural swing-low
#     has ALSO closed broken before lifting protection (Sperandeo 1-2-3
#     failed-retest; Bulkowski retest rate). Most patient.
#   DEFAULT — everything else (against the trend, weak/tangled tape, or no trend
#     data): the EXISTING ratified floor — two consecutive confirmed closes
#     beyond 1.0 ATR, reclaim resets (Edwards & Magee two-consecutive-day close
#     filter; Wyckoff spring).
#
# There is deliberately NO single-close path: lifting protection on one close
# would reverse the ratified two-close spring rule and add whipsaw. DIRECTION is
# Weinstein/Dow: price vs a RISING/FALLING 200-day MA (the SLOPE, so a real top
# is not read as "still uptrend") plus the 50/200 stack. STRENGTH is Wilder's
# ADX — only the single >=25 "strong" threshold is used, to ENTER the patient
# regime. The 25 threshold and the 14-session ADX period GATE behaviour, so they
# are trade-governing and sourced to Wilder (1978).
#
# Board item 70, 2026-09-26: this margin used to BE the noise-band constant.
# It is now its own name, `BREAK_CONFIRMATION_ATR_MULTIPLE`, at the same 1.0
# value and with no behaviour change — see that constant for why the published
# literature gives this quantity no ATR basis at all.

#: Consecutive confirmed daily closes beyond the level required to treat ANY
#: break as real. SOURCED: the two-consecutive-day close filter in Edwards &
#: Magee, Technical Analysis of Stock Trends — a level breaks on a decisive
#: close, confirmed on the next day's close, and a reclaim in between resets
#: (Wyckoff spring). Applies in BOTH regimes; the strong-with-trend regime adds
#: a STRUCTURAL condition (the prior swing-low must also break) on top, never a
#: larger close count.

#: Wilder's ADX reading at or above which a trend is treated as STRONG (New
#: Concepts in Technical Trading Systems, 1978; the standard convention that
#: ADX>25 is a trend strong enough to trade with). GATES behaviour: at/above

#: prior swing-low must also break). Below it, the default two-close floor.

    """Classify an adverse structural break into a confirmation REGIME, per the
    owner mandate 2026-09-24 (trend-scaled exit) and its citation-backed spec.
    Exit speed scales with how strongly the break aligns with the prevailing
    trend. Pure and side-aware.

    The "adverse break" is the one that would lift protection: for a LONG,
    price falling through support; for a SHORT, price rising through resistance.

    DIRECTION (Weinstein stage analysis; Dow theory). For a LONG, "with a strong
    trend" (an uptrend an adverse dip is likely a shakeout WITHIN) means price
    ABOVE a RISING 200-day MA *and* the 50MA above the 200MA. Anything else —
    price below a falling 200MA, 50MA<200MA, flat/tangled MAs, or no MA data — is
    the DEFAULT regime. For a SHORT it mirrors: strong-with-trend is price below
    a FALLING 200MA and 50MA<200MA (a strong downtrend). Using the 200MA SLOPE
    (not the level alone) is what stops a real top being read as "still an
    uptrend": once the 200MA rolls over, the position is no longer with-trend.

    STRENGTH (Wilder 1978, ADX): only the single >=`ADX_STRONG_TREND_THRESHOLD`
    (25) "strong" test is used, to ENTER the patient regime.

    Returns one of:
      - REGIME_STRONG_WITH_TREND — break with a STRONG uptrend (ADX>=25 and the
                                   structure above). The shakeout-most-likely
                                   case: the two-close floor AND the prior
                                   structural swing-low must also break.
