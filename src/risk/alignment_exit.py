"""The ALIGNMENT EXIT — the desk's only sanctioned way to realise a gain.

Owner ruling, 2026-09-30: *"exit on ALIGNMENT, never on a target"*, and the
same day's correction: *"it doesn't have to be all three in alignment.
Structure, volatility and trend don't all have to agree. Just agree in
alignment. The chart alone can tell us what to do."*

So this is NOT a three-way vote and NOT a quorum. It is ONE READING.

  * STRUCTURE and TREND supply MARKS — prices the chart says matter. A
    confirmed-broken structural level is a mark. The moving average the
    position's own thesis names is a mark, as is the next longer average
    the desk already computes; when the thesis names no average the desk
    computes, the chart's OWN averages are the marks instead, so no
    position is left unreadable by how a model happened to word its
    thesis. Same kind of thing, read off the same
    bars, so they go into one set rather than into separate ballots.
  * VOLATILITY supplies the UNIT and the TOLERANCE. It is not a condition;
    it is how the single distance below the last mark is judged real.

ONE comparison decides, and it is STRUCTURE, not a give-back: the trend
is broken when the chart has confirmed it. For a long that is either the
most recent confirmed swing low printing BELOW the one before it (a lower
low), or a completed close BELOW the last confirmed higher low; a short
mirrors both against swing highs. The swings are the trailing stop's own
(`src.risk.trail_structure._swing_lows` / `_swing_highs`), confirmed with
its existing `src.risk.trailing.PIVOT_WINDOW` (3 bars each side). No new
number is introduced. When no swing is confirmed yet the rule does not
fire and says so ("no swing reference"); the trailing stop still protects.

The marks (structure and trend) are still read and recorded, because they
are what the review and the owner report show; they no longer decide.

It never exits on a price TARGET alone, never summarises the instrument's
past into a statistic, and is never anchored to what the desk paid. The
target is ONE VOTE (owner, 2026-10-08): it is read, recorded on every
verdict and counted, and it never sells alone. Since 2026-10-09 it no
longer picks a give-back mark, because there is no give-back mark.

WHY THE 3.0 ATR GIVE-BACK WAS DELETED (2026-10-09)
--------------------------------------------------
The old trigger sold when the close sat more than 3.0 x ATR(14) below the
last lost chart mark. That 3.0 was never measured: the published 2.5-3.5
band (Wilder 1978; Le Beau's Chandelier) is calibrated from a running
EXTREME on ATR(22), not from a moving average on ATR(14), so the citation
did not transfer, and its ledger row sat `arbitrary` waiting on a
measurement that was never run. The exit was KEPT, not deleted, because
it can fire before the 3.0 ATR Chandelier trail in at least four cases;
only its made-up trigger was replaced by the structure test above.
