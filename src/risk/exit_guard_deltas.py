#:
#: `distance_to_stop_pct = (current - stop) / current * 100`
#: (`TradingPipeline._build_position_facts`). Both terms move. Raise the
#: price and it improves — that is a real improvement. LOWER THE STOP and it
#: also improves, and nothing about the position got better; the desk just
#: took off some of its own protection.
#:
#: Verified on real recorded snapshots, 2026-09-01 midday vs the 2026-08-31
#: close (`specialist_evidence`, agent_name='position_reviewer',
#: kind='review_metrics'):
#:   V      distance-to-stop 1.42 -> 3.41 "improved" while r_multiple fell
#:          -0.11 -> -0.82. Price fell and distance rose, which is only
#:          possible if the stop moved down (entry 381.18 / stop 374.27 at
#:          entry; the implied stop by 09-01 midday is ~362.7).
#:   CMCSA  3.53 -> 5.58 "improved" while r_multiple fell -0.04 -> -0.33.
#:   DIS    1.85 -> 5.07 "improved" while thesis progress fell
#:          -3.06 -> -12.50.
#: In all three the position was demonstrably deteriorating and one of the
#: four "things improved" measures said otherwise.
#:
#: The fix is decomposition, not deletion — see
#: `MetricDeltas.stop_driven`. Deleting the metric would lose the genuine
#: and load-bearing case: a position whose PRICE has risen away from a
#: FIXED stop really has improved, and that is the case the metric was

    new information, which the reviewer keeps full authority to make (spec
    Phase 3.8).

    `deltas` is trusted to already be direction-corrected for a short, so

    per-metric, 2026-09-18 (each is computed in
    `TradingPipeline._build_position_facts` unless noted):
      - `thesis_progress_pct` — side-correct by construction: both
        `(cur - entry)` and `(progress_target - entry)` flip sign together
        for a short, so the ratio is unchanged.
      - `pace` — inherits `thesis_progress_pct`'s correctness; the
        denominator (`time_fraction`) is never signed.
      - `r_multiple` — side-correct by construction (`src/risk/metrics.py
        ::r_multiple` takes `qty`'s sign as the side and mirrors both the
        numerator and the risk-per-share denominator for a short).
      - `distance_to_stop_pct` — was NOT side-correct until 2026-09-18: it
        was computed as `(cur - stop_loss) / cur * 100` regardless of side,
        which is correct for a long (stop below price) but for a short
        (stop above price) is negative and moves the WRONG way — it gets
        MORE negative, i.e. reads as "worse" under `_HIGHER_IS_BETTER`, as
        the price moves further from the stop and the position gets safer.
        Fixed by mirroring the numerator for `qty < 0`. Any snapshot
        written before that fix still has old-formula (mis-signed for
        shorts) values, so a delta spanning that boundary is stale, not
        wrong — it self-heals after one review cycle.
