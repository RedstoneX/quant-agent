"""OpenRouter remaining credit -- the figure src/llm_balance_runway.py times.

The only outbound GET goes through `src.cost_table.http_get_json`, the module

the rehearsal replay (scripts/replay_outbound_guard.py, board item 202). Under
the rehearsal wall the socket is refused and that refusal is what
fetch_openrouter_balance raises, by name. Nothing returns None for "could not
