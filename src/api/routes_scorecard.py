"""Read-only analyst scorecard over the conviction ledger (spec §9.5).

One GET route, `/analysts/scorecard`. It reads the ledger's persisted
`conviction_credit` and `seat_stance` evidence rows through
`db_reads.get_conviction_ledger()` — an independent SQLite `mode=ro`
connection, like every other read in this package — and projects them into
the shape the Mission Control panel renders.

**It scores nothing.** The realized `r_multiple` and the alignment call
(`side`) are decided by the ledger layer when a position closes and written
down; this module only adds them up. Concretely: no `r_multiple` is computed
here and no stance is re-classified as supporting or opposing.

**Credit is raw signed R.** There is no conviction weight to apply — it was
removed by owner decision on 2026-08-31, because weighting an analyst's credit
by its own declared confidence assumes the very thing the ledger exists to
measure, and because a confident call already earns a bigger position and so a
bigger R. What replaced it is `by_confidence`: each analyst's record split by
the confidence it declared, so a reader can see whether its confident calls
actually earn more instead of being told so by a multiplier.

**A short reads exactly like a long.** Direction is carried on an idea for
description only. A short that made money is a positive number and a win; the
analyst that argued for it is credited and the one that argued against it is
charged — the same words, the same sign, the same side of zero as a long.
Nothing in this module or the panel it feeds inverts anything on direction.

**Why the arithmetic below is not imported from the ledger.**
`src.conviction_ledger.aggregate_seat_records` produces the same per-analyst
totals, and importing it would be the obvious move — but that module imports
`src.risk.rules`, and `tests/test_api_safety.py` forbids any `src.risk` import
from `src/api/` (the Stage 2 isolation invariant recorded in
`docs/architecture/MISSION_CONTROL_API.md`). Preserving the isolation contract
wins over avoiding the duplication, so the running-total/peak/average
arithmetic is mirrored here instead. `tests/test_api_scorecard.py` carries a
parity test that compares this projection against `aggregate_seat_records`
whenever that module is importable, so the two cannot silently drift apart.

**Advisory only, and read-only twice over.** Per §9.5 item 6 no score here
feeds sizing, and per the Mission Control contract this process cannot write
anything at all. Per §9.5 item 8 there is no minimum-sample gate: raw counts
are returned for every analyst, however few calls it has resolved.
