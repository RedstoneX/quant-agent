"""The held-position exit engine: everything that decides whether an open
position is SOLD, and the one method that executes the resulting actions.

Step 4 of `docs/PIPELINE_SPLIT_PLAN.md` (board item 210), clusters K and L,
re-measured against the step-3 branch before anything was touched. Moved
verbatim out of `src/pipeline.py` as a mixin, so `TradingPipeline` keeps every
one of these as its own attribute and every test that patches or calls them is
untouched.

This is the live-money SELL path: target-revision adjudication, structural
protection for a holding and the voicing of its break, exit-trigger
substantiation, the holding-discipline fact-check, the deterministic trails and
their ratchet cooldown, the event-risk block, the alignment exit (scan, cache,
per-holding verdict and reading record), the AI risk review of exits, the
refusal and approval records, and `_midday_execute_llm_actions`.

The module-level exit-trigger vocabulary travels with it: the
`_HARD_TRIGGER_KEYWORDS` tuple and `_reason_cites_hard_trigger`, plus
`_actions_with_scan_fallback` and `_reason_claims_alignment_exit`, whose only
caller is `_midday_execute_llm_actions`. All are re-exported from `src.pipeline`
so `from src.pipeline import ...` keeps working -- but a test that PATCHES one
of them on `src.pipeline` no longer reaches this module's code and must patch it
here instead (plan S5, silent-behaviour risk 1).

`_atr_for_symbol` sits inside this cluster's range and deliberately did NOT
move: it is read by the base class's `_evening_stop_proximity` and by
`PromptFactsMixin`, so it stays in `src/pipeline.py` as a thin delegation,
which lends it back to this mixin. Its neighbour `_constructor_cfg_or_none`
is GONE (2026-10-05): the deleted admission shell was its only caller.

Nothing here may import `src.pipeline`: this module is one of its bases.
