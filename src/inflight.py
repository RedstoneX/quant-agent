"""What is being built RIGHT NOW, read off GitHub — never typed in by hand.

Why this exists
---------------
The owner's words: "I'm kind of clueless unless you tell me stuff, everything
is in the background." The status board shows what is decided and what needs
him. It did not show what is actually under construction, so the only way he
learned that was by asking — the exact gap the board exists to close.

The honest source of truth for "in flight" is the repository itself: an OPEN
PULL REQUEST is work that exists, is not merged, and is not yet real. A
hand-maintained list would rot the way every other hand-maintained status
document here has rotted, so this reads the open pull requests from GitHub
and derives everything it shows from that.

How it reads GitHub, and why not `gh`
-------------------------------------
The repository is public. GitHub's REST API answers read-only requests for a
public repository with NO credential at all, so this uses plain HTTPS from
the standard library: no `gh` login, no token on the account that trades
(putting a GitHub credential on that account is an owner decision, not a
convenience for a status page — see the `pr_merged` rule in
`scripts/status_board.py`, which says the same). A token IS honoured if one
is present in the environment (`GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN`), which only
raises the rate limit; nothing here needs it.

Unauthenticated reads are rate-limited per address, so every request is
CONDITIONAL: the last ETag GitHub returned is sent back, and a "304 Not
Modified" answer — which GitHub does not count against the limit — reuses
the body already held. In steady state, re-reading an unchanged set of pull
requests costs nothing.

How it degrades
---------------
Loudly, and never into an empty list. "Could not read what is in flight" and
"nothing is in flight" are different facts and the page must never confuse
them: a silent empty list that really means "I could not look" is the
failure class this desk keeps finding. So the result carries either the
items it read or a plain-English reason it could not read them, and the
renderer says which. A partially readable pull request (the list came back
but its own status did not) is still listed, with its status reported as
unreadable rather than guessed.

Who reads the output
--------------------
The owner, on a phone. So: no branch names, no commit hashes, no CI jargon.
Each item is the pull request's title — written by the engineering side, in
plain words — plus, in words, whether it is still being written, being
tested, waiting to be merged, or blocked. The pull request NUMBER is kept:
it is the one handle both sides already use to refer to a change.
