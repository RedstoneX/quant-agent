# === Fill-confirmation alerts (own message, not bundled) ===
#
# 2026-09-17. The desk confirms a fill by polling the broker over REST
# inside a bounded window. That path is now the ONLY fill-confirmation
# mechanism: `execution.fill_stream_enabled` is off, because the
# `trade_updates` websocket has never once authenticated on this host (see
# that flag for the two confirmed blockers). Nothing about that is an
# incident — it is the intended configuration.
#
# What WAS silent to the owner is the case that actually matters: the REST
# window ending without the broker having confirmed what happened to an
# order, or the half-hourly reconciliation finding the desk's own record
# and the broker's record disagreeing with no sale to explain the gap.
# Before these two alerts, both only ever reached a log line the owner
# never reads — the same failure shape as the 2026-08-28 ONDS/CCJ
# stop-outs, which sat silent for a full trading day.
#
# WHAT MUST NEVER PAGE: the websocket being off. That is the configuration,
# not a fault, and alerting on it would move ~150 daily error lines out of
# the log and into Telegram, which is worse. Neither condition below looks
# at the socket at all — both are true or false identically with the flag
# on or off.
#
# Standard owner alert-design rules (2026-09-02), same as the data-quality
# alert above: its OWN Telegram message, never a line in a run summary;
# severity carried in TEXT, never colour; NOT deduplicated, so a still-
# broken thing keeps alerting. Plain English, no jargon, no run ids, and
# any time is 12-hour with AM/PM and the timezone (`fmt_time_12h`).
#
# Neither function raises. An alerting bug must not break the execution or
# reconciliation path it reports on.
