"""Delivery discipline for the owner alert: retry, then a counted durable row.

Owner ruling 2026-10-02 (ACT, never just alert): a send that failed must not
be indistinguishable from one that landed. The funnel `send_owner_alert` runs
every caller through `deliver_with_retry`, so the ~30 call sites that discard
the return value get this behaviour without each one being edited.

Never raises: a failing alert path must not abort the money path it reports on.
