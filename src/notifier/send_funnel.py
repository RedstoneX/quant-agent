"""Every Telegram send goes through the retry funnel, because `send` IS it.

The owner-alert discipline (retry a failure, then write a counted
`owner_alert_undelivered` row) used to live only in `send_owner_alert`, so any
code that built its own `TelegramNotifier` and called `send` escaped it
entirely -- a dropped session summary was indistinguishable from a delivered
one. That was opt-in discipline, and opt-in discipline is forgotten.

So the single attempt is `send_once` and the public `send` is the funnel.
There is no longer a way to reach the wire without it: a caller cannot bypass
a method by calling the same method. Both are bound onto `TelegramNotifier`
in `transport.py`; they live here because that file is at its size ceiling.

    Not the public entry point: `TelegramNotifier.send` is, and it runs
    this through the retry-and-record funnel. Called directly only by
    `deliver_with_outcome`, which owns the attempt loop.

    `kind` and `run_id` (2026-09-18) label the durable record this
    call leaves behind (see `_record_send`) — `kind` is a short,
    caller-chosen tag ("morning", "owner_alert", ...; default
    "generic" for the many existing callers that have no reason to
    care), `run_id` ties it back to `agent_logs`/`session_reports`
    when a run produced this message. Neither changes delivery.

    - No-op when not enabled (returns False).
    - Escapes `text` and sends with `parse_mode="HTML"` — a stray
      underscore/asterisk/`<`/`&` in a ticker or a rationale must not
      corrupt the message or get the whole send rejected by Telegram.
    - Appends a tap-through `<a href>` link when one is available:
      `link_url` if given, else `self.mission_control_url` (from
      config). Neither set → no link, ever — never a broken one.
    - `symbols`, when given, wraps each matching ticker mentioned in
      `text` with its own tap-through link (see `_linkify_symbols`) —
      best-effort: if adding links would push the message over budget,
      it degrades to plain text rather than risk truncating markup.
    - Auto-truncates messages over MAX_MESSAGE_CHARS on a sentence/word
      boundary (see `_clip_text`) rather than mid-word.
    - Any HTTP / network / Telegram-side error is logged and
      swallowed: trading must never fail because a notifier is
      unreachable.
    - `preserve_structural_markup=False` (default): `text` is fully
      escaped — the historical, safe contract every existing caller
      relies on (cost-circuit alerts, `send_owner_alert`, scripts/*,
      none of which ever intend a literal '<' as a tag). Pass True
      ONLY for text built by src/trader_feed.py's formatters, which
      embed a fixed, small set of literal structural tags (`<b>`,
      `<blockquote expandable>`) on purpose — see
      `_escape_with_markup`'s docstring. This is opt-in, per call, not
      a global default, so a coincidental literal "<b>" in some other
      alert's free text is still rendered as visible text, not markup.
