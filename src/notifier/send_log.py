    """Durably record one outgoing-message attempt (sent/failed/
    suppressed) so "what did the desk try to tell the owner, and did
    it arrive" has a single answer that does not depend on the next
    message happening to land.

    Table, not a log line (see this file's module docstring for why
    `send()` never logged a success): `session_reports` /
    `intra_check_reports` / `evening_reports` (src/storage/db.py) are
    this project's established home for a run's long, rendered text —
    never the application log, which is grepped/tailed for operational
    health and would drown in 4000-char message bodies. This table
    follows the same shape (payload text + timestamp + a key to find
    it by) rather than inventing a new convention.

    Same-protection guarantee as the rest of this class: this is
    called from inside `send()`/`send_document()`'s own try/except
    (or, for the failure path, adds one more try/except around
    itself), so a recording bug — a locked DB file, a full disk, a
    schema mismatch — degrades to a `logger.warning` and the message
    still sends and the caller still gets its True/False. Recording
    must never be the reason a send looks like it failed, or the
    reason a real failure looks like it succeeded.

    Redaction: `text` and `detail` both go through `self._redact`
    before they touch SQLite. `text` should never carry the token or
    chat id (they live in the URL/payload, not the message body), but
    redacting here anyway costs nothing and means one place — not
    every call site — is responsible for the guarantee tested by
    `test_record_send_output_never_contains_token_or_chat_id`.
