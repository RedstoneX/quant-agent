"""The widened owner-alert funnel: one door, carrying what honest callers need.

`send_owner_alert` built its own `TelegramNotifier`, hardcoded the record
`kind`, and threw away the suppression outcome. Two legitimate callers — the
cost circuit's alert-outcome helper and the naked-position alert — therefore
could not use it: they are handed a notifier, they label their own rows, and
one of them must distinguish a deliberate drop from a failure. They went
straight to the delivery layer instead, which is exactly the side door the
no-side-door guard exists to refuse.

Narrowing the guard would reopen the defect it closed (a failed direct send
vanishing with no trace). So the funnel grows instead: an injected notifier,
a per-alert `kind`, a `run_id` that reaches the durable row, an explicit
attempt budget, and the full (delivered, suppressed) outcome returned rather
than collapsed to a bool.

Every property of the narrow funnel is preserved: the CRITICAL journal line
goes out before any network call, the P&L block is attached at this one
choke point, retries stay bounded with a timeout-bearing transport, a send
that never lands still writes one counted durable row, and nothing here
raises.
