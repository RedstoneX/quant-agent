"""Portfolio Constructor — turns PM target-state into concrete orders.

Phase 2 of the architecture work. Previously the LLM (Portfolio Manager)
emitted TradeDecision objects directly, including entry_price / stop_loss /
take_profit. That put the LLM dangerously close to the execution layer:
- fat-finger-protection patches
- vol-adjusted sizing patches
- stop-limit buffer patches
- sub-penny quantize patches
...were all band-aids for "LLM output an execution detail it shouldn't own."

Now PM emits TargetPosition (target_weight_pct, conviction, thesis,
invalid_if) and this module derives the actual orders from:
- Target state
- Current positions (broker truth)
- TA's ATR + suggested stop (for stop distance)
- Broker's live price (for entry price)
- Total equity + cash (for sizing)

The constructor is deterministic and unit-testable. LLM creativity is
confined to intent; math is code.

#: this desk hold?". Three limits used to claim to answer it; only TWO are
#: independent, and this constant is the canonical written form of which one
#: binds. The portfolio manager's sector-preview prompt points here.
#:
#: THE THIRD LIMIT IS NOT A LIMIT. `alloc_cap_by_risk` in `_build_buy` /
#: `_build_short` below reads as a separate notional cap, but it is computed
#: as `risk_budget_pct x entry / |entry - stop|` — it is the SAME 5%
#: per-position risk envelope, re-expressed in notional units so it can be
#: compared against the notional ceiling. It cannot bind on an order the
#: envelope would not; it is a unit conversion, not a bound.
#:
#: So two bounds remain, both in the same unit (percent of total account
#: equity, raw notional, before the gross multiplier) against the same
#: denominator (`total_value`), and they cross exactly once — at a stop
#: distance of `risk_budget_pct / max_position_pct x 100` percent of entry
#: price. Wider stop: the risk envelope binds. Tighter stop: the ceiling
#: binds. `single_name_crossover_stop_pct()` below computes that crossover
#: from the live config rather than restating it.
#:
#: MEASURED against the production order record, 2026-09-02..2026-09-30
#: (38 constructor entry orders carrying a stop; 8 cash-sweep ETF buys are
#: not constructor-sized and carry no stop, so they are unattributable):
#: the single-name notional ceiling bound 4 of 38, every one of them at a
#: stop distance tighter than the crossover. The risk envelope bound 0 of 38
#: — the largest risk any order requested was 3.0%, under the 5% envelope —
#: and its notional image bound 0 of 38. The `trade_refusals` table is
#: EMPTY, so no refusal could be attributed to any limit at all.

# through 38 signals and zero trades on 2026-09-01. The codes are for logs and
# tests; the message beside each one is written for a reader who does not know
# the code.
STOP_RULE_LEVEL_HONOURED = "stop_honoured_at_computed_level"
STOP_RULE_ABSOLUTE_FLOOR = "stop_widened_to_absolute_atr_floor"
STOP_RULE_ATR_BAND = "stop_widened_to_atr_noise_band"
# The two paths that leave the stop exactly where structure put it. Both
# existed before 2026-09-02 as unnamed early returns, and that anonymity is
# precisely how they escaped the reward:risk floor for two weeks — see
# `_widen_stop_past_noise`. Named now, for the same reason every other
# outcome is named.
STOP_RULE_OUTSIDE_BAND = "stop_kept_already_outside_atr_band"
#: RETIRED as a shipping rule (board item 80, 2026-09-25, reworked). This named
#: the one branch that honoured a typed stop with NO ATR to verify it against,
#: letting an unverifiable distance size a position. That branch now DERIVES the
#: stop from price structure and HOLDS (`STOP_RULE_STRUCTURAL_NO_ATR` /
#: `STOP_RULE_PRIOR_BAR_NO_ATR`), refusing only when no structure is readable,
#: so no shipping stop carries this rule any more. Kept defined only so the
#: `_GEOMETRY_REFUSAL_BY_RULE` lookup and any historical record referencing the
#: string still resolve.
STOP_RULE_NO_VOLATILITY = "stop_kept_no_atr_reading"
STOP_REFUSAL_WRONG_SIDE = "stop_on_wrong_side_of_entry"
#: The unbacked-stop fallback placed the stop under the SIGNAL BAR's low
#: (above its high for a short) because that sat further from entry than
#: the ATR noise band did. Kristjan Kullamägi's own placement for a stop
#: with no level under it — "the low of the day" — read from the last
#: completed bar the analyst judged (`TechAnalysisResult.signal_bar_low` /
#: `signal_bar_high`, Python-set from the same bars as the levels). Rare by
#: construction: it only wins when the signal bar itself spans more than
#: the noise band, i.e. a climactic bar.
STOP_RULE_SIGNAL_BAR = "stop_placed_past_signal_bar"
#: No-ATR structural fallback (owner ruling 2026-09-25, board item 80).
#: The protective stop was READ from price structure because there was no
#: volatility reading to place one from: `STRUCTURAL_NO_ATR` sits one
#: buffer beyond the nearest VERIFIED computed level on the protective
#: side of entry (a swing-low / structure stop); `PRIOR_BAR_NO_ATR` sits
#: one buffer beyond the last completed bar's far edge (a prior-bar low
#: stop) when no computed level qualifies. Both HOLD the position -- a
#: missing ATR is never a reason to skip protection.
STOP_RULE_STRUCTURAL_NO_ATR = "stop_read_from_structure_no_atr"
STOP_RULE_PRIOR_BAR_NO_ATR = "stop_read_from_prior_bar_no_atr"
#: RETIRED as a live refusal (board item 56, route (c), 2026-09-26). This
#: named the stop-WIDTH gate: whatever placed the stop, a width past
#: `horizon_reach` (ATR x sqrt(horizon) x a 1.5 multiple nothing derived)
#: refused the trade outright. It is DELETED, and the deletion is measured,
#: not argued: across 648 sized stops recorded in production between
#: 2026-09-13 and 2026-09-26 (`quant_agent.log`, the touch-probability
#: reading below) it refused ZERO trades, and the widest stop it ever saw
#: sat at 1.29 x ATR x sqrt(H) against its 1.5 cap. It could not have fired
#: on the desk's own fallback stop at any horizon of three sessions or more
#: (2.5 ATR vs 1.5 x sqrt(3) = 2.60 ATR), and every horizon the desk has
#: ever stated was 6 sessions or longer. What it claimed to protect --
#: "a size computed off a distance price will not travel is fiction" -- is
#: already answered, in the direction published practice prescribes, by the
#: ratified sizing invariant (§2.1, `_plan_risk_targets`: same dollars of
#: risk, wider stop, fewer shares) and, at the extreme, by
#: `STOP_REFUSAL_SIZED_TO_ZERO`. The threshold it needed was never read off
#: anything: no published work fixes the touch probability below which a
#: stop stops being a stop. The READING survives the gate and is stamped on
#: every sized stop (`src.data.levels.touch_probability`), because that is
#: the evidence that could one day answer the question.
#:
#: Kept defined as a greppable key: it appears in pre-deletion production
#: records and in docs/INCIDENT_HISTORY.md, and the blocked-proposal census
#: (`scripts/blocked_proposals_census.py`) must still be able to name it.
#: NOTHING EMITS IT ANY MORE, and `tests/test_stop_width_gate.py` fails if
#: anything starts to.
STOP_REFUSAL_WIDER_THAN_REACH = "stop_wider_than_instrument_reach"
#: RETIRED as a constructor refusal (board item 180, owner ruling 2026-09-25).
#: This named the young-listing refusal that fired on a bar COUNT: fewer
#: completed sessions than `LONGEST_INDICATOR_WINDOW` (200) and the trade was
#: turned away, however readable its stop and levels were. The owner dropped
#: the count gate: a young listing is TRADEABLE when a defensible protective
#: stop is readable from whatever bars exist and the seats clear it, and is
#: refused ONLY when no stop can be read from the instrument -- the existing
#: stop-readability rule (`_derive_structural_stop_no_atr` /
#: `STOP_REFUSAL_NO_STRUCTURAL_STOP_NO_VOLATILITY`, board item 80) is now the
#: real gate, catching same-day-IPO / near-zero-bar names on what the trade
#: needs rather than on a calendar count. Indicators already degrade to the
#: bars that exist (`compute_indicators`), so a short history simply leaves
#: `ma_200` = None, which the exit guard treats as UNPARSEABLE for any
#: `thesis_invalid_if` that references it. The string is deliberately NOT
#: reused here; the universe screen and the transient-admission lane keep
#: their own separate `insufficient_history` gates (out of this item's scope).
#: retired board item 49 (`docs/INCIDENT_HISTORY.md`, 2026-09-14). The portfolio risk budget was spent
#: before this candidate's turn came round. NOT a judgement about the idea:
#: it passed every gate, and on a day with fewer competing names it would
#: have been bought. The only reason it produced no order is that better-
#: ranked names took the 25% ceiling first.
#:
#: This exists because the budget denial was the ONE constructor drop path
#: with no durable per-symbol reason at all: it logged
#: "Constructor: X produces no order — risk budget granted 0% ...", which
#: `_DropReasonCapture._SYMBOL` does not match (it requires
#: rejected|refused|skipped after the symbol), so every budget-rationed name
#: reached `_record_constructor_drops` as the generic `constructor_dropped`
#: with detail "no matching constructor log line captured". Once the budget
#: actually binds on a normal day — which is what item 49 is about — that is
#: the largest silent bucket on the sheet. Verified on this branch before the
#: fix by running the capture's own regex against the real message.
STOP_REFUSAL_BUDGET_EXHAUSTED = "risk_budget_exhausted"
#: Defect 2026-10-09: some holding's risk is UNKNOWN (no usable price, or
#: the book could not be read at all), so the 25% total-risk ceiling cannot
#: be checked. Every risk-ADDING order is refused under this code until the
#: holding is read; closes, exits and stops are never blocked by it.
STOP_REFUSAL_BOOK_RISK_UNKNOWN = "book_risk_unknown"
#: Defect 2026-10-09: a dollar-only (weight, no risk %) target that would
#: add exposure, for which no stop could be resolved, so it cannot be
#: converted to risk and charged against the 25% ceiling. Refused by name.
STOP_REFUSAL_DOLLAR_TARGET_NO_STOP = "dollar_target_no_stop"
#: Board item 10 (2026-09-14): the same defect item 49 fixed for the
#: PORTFOLIO-level budget allocator, found again by statically running
#: `_DropReasonCapture._SYMBOL` against every other constructor drop message
#: in the module (no live data needed — the regex is deterministic and the
#: messages are compile-time strings). §9.4's OTHER refusal path — the net
#: independent source score landing at or below zero — used
#: the identical "Constructor: X produces no order — ..." phrasing item 49
#: already found the regex does not match (it requires rejected|refused|
#: skipped directly after the symbol; "produces" is neither), and reached
#: `_record_constructor_drops` the same generic way. Fixed the same way:
#: `_note_refusal` files the code as data instead of relying on the log
#: scrape ever catching up to a sentence.
STOP_REFUSAL_AGREEMENT_NET = "agreement_net_at_or_below_zero"
#: Board item 10 (2026-09-14). `_build_buy`/`_build_short` already LOG when
#: the risk-budget-per-trade cap or the single-name ceiling
#: shrinks a request ("alloc capped by risk budget" / "... by the single-
#: name ceiling"), but neither message contains rejected/refused/skipped, so
#: the regex never matches them. When one of those caps (or the sector dial
#: above them) leaves nothing to round to above zero, the order silently
#: never ships — and unlike the ATR/no-stop path a few lines up, there is no
#: SECOND log line for the same symbol that happens to match: `_build_buy`
#: just returns `None`. Filed directly from `cap_note`, which already
#: carries the deterministic provenance of whichever cap(s) bound.
STOP_REFUSAL_SIZED_TO_ZERO = "position_sized_to_zero"
#: Board item 10 (2026-09-14). `apply_gross_ceiling` (`src/risk/rules.py`)
#: refuses a BUY/SHORT outright — equity unusable, headroom below the
#: minimum-order floor, or a granted slice that rounds to nothing — and logs
#: through its OWN `Constructor: %s`-wrapped note (`portfolio_constructor.py`
#: relays `outcome.notes` verbatim at `logger.warning("Constructor: %s",
#: note)`). Every one of those notes reads "Constructor: max_gross_exposure:
#: SYMBOL refused — ..." — the rule name sits BETWEEN "Constructor:" and the
#: symbol, which `_DropReasonCapture._SYMBOL` requires to follow immediately
#: (optionally through one of BUY/SHORT/SELL/COVER only). Every gross-ceiling
#: block was therefore invisible to the regex. `GrossCeilingOutcome.
#: blocked_detail` now carries the per-symbol reason text out of
#: `apply_gross_ceiling` so the constructor can file it with `_note_refusal`
#: directly, the same precedent as every other code in this block.
STOP_REFUSAL_GROSS_EXPOSURE_CEILING = "gross_exposure_ceiling_refused"
#: RETIRED (owner ruling 2026-09-30, board item 183). This named the delta
#: loop's churn filter: `min_trade_weight_delta`, a picked 0.5%-of-book
#: floor, silently `continue`d past a delta below it — a brand-new position
#: too small to bother with left no `TradeDecision` row and no log line at
#: all, and an existing one got a HOLD instead of the trade it asked for.
#: The owner ruled the desk gets autonomy to nudge a position whenever its
#: own reasoning calls for it; a flat unsourced percentage that silently
#: overrides that judgement is gone, not resized. See
#: `config/number_ledger.yaml`'s now-deleted entry for the measurement that
#: already showed the cost side could not justify a floor this size. Kept
#: defined as a greppable key only because it appears in
#: `tests/test_owner_message_cannot_mislead.py` / `tests/test_trader_feed.py`
#: fixture data exercising the generic refusal-reporting path, which is
#: unaffected by this constant's retirement — NOTHING EMITS IT ANY MORE.
CONSTRUCTOR_NO_ACTION_BELOW_MIN_DELTA = "delta_below_min_trade_weight"
#: The two reasons that REPLACE it — both read off the request itself, and
#: neither is a threshold. Deleting `min_trade_weight_delta` deleted the only
#: reason this loop ever filed, and two things still reach its no-op arm
#: without producing an order. `tests/test_every_drop_path_files_a_reason.py`
#: fails if either goes back to being silent.
#:
#: 1. The desk named a candidate and asked for a weight of ZERO on a name it
#:    holds none of. Measured in the production archive this repo already
#:    ships (`tests/fixtures/constructor_drop_paths_archive.json`): all 8 of
#:    the candidates left anonymous by the floor's removal are this exact
#:    case — `target_weight_pct == 0.0` against a zero holding, not a small
#:    request. The old message called these "smaller than the desk's
#:    minimum", which was never true of a zero. Nothing was judged wrong
#:    with the idea; the desk asked for no position.
CONSTRUCTOR_TARGET_WEIGHT_ZERO_NOTHING_HELD = "target_weight_zero_nothing_held"
#: 2. A held SHORT whose target equals what is already short. The long side
#:    of this arm emits a HOLD row and the symbol survives; the short side
#:    emits none, because HOLD's audit bookkeeping in this stage is long-only
#:    (pre-existing, unchanged here), so without this the position silently
#:    produced nothing. This is "already where the desk wants it", NOT a
#:    refusal of the idea — the prose says so.
CONSTRUCTOR_SHORT_ALREADY_AT_TARGET = "short_already_at_target_weight"
#: 3. Owner ruling 2026-10-09 (docs/OUTCOME.md): a HELD position is kept at
#:    its size or exited whole — never partly sold by the planner, whether
#:    the desk's own risk number came down or the budget granted less. Such
#:    a cut is refused by this code and the position is held unchanged. Only
#:    the gross-ceiling de-lever (its own order path) partly cuts a holding.
CONSTRUCTOR_HELD_PARTIAL_TRIM_REFUSED = "held_partial_trim_refused"
#: NOT a replacement for `min_trade_weight_delta`. `signed_target` and
#: `current_pct` are both floats built from independent divisions (a live
#: price against total_value vs. a model-typed percent), so a delta the
#: desk did not actually ask for — "hold exactly what is held" — can land a
#: few ULPs off zero rather than bit-exact. This is the same role
#: `_FRACTIONAL_QTY_EPSILON` already plays for share quantities elsewhere in
#: this codebase (`src/execution/broker.py`): it recognises floating-point
#: representation noise as "no request", never as a size the desk judged
#: too small. Nine orders of magnitude below the finest weight either a
#: model or a human types, so it is not a floor on any real nudge.
_NO_REAL_WEIGHT_DELTA_PCT = 1e-9
#: 2026-09-17 (intra_check-44594a05). A risk-based TRIM of a held name this
#: session did not analyse is sized from the position's live broker stop

#: MACHINE-READABLE: eight more sites still ended a candidate with nothing but
#: a sentence in a log line, recovered by regex into a generic
#: `constructor_dropped` row whose `reason` column is the same for all of
#: them. One of those eight — no typed stop AND no ATR to read one from — the
#: regex misses outright ("Constructor: BUY SYM has no stop ...", and the
#: pattern requires rejected|refused|skipped straight after the symbol), so
#: the "five is the complete set" claim was wrong on its own terms. Codes
#: below, one per site, filed with `_note_refusal` exactly like the rest. The
#: rule this whole item is about, stated once: a candidate is never dropped
#: without a durable, per-symbol, machine-readable reason.

#: no ATR outright (`typed_stop_but_no_volatility_reading`); that was
#: wrong per the ruling -- a missing volatility reading is never a reason
#: to skip protection. The branch now derives the stop from price
#: structure and HOLDS, and only ONE refusal remains:
#:  * NO_STRUCTURAL_STOP_NO_VOLATILITY -- no ATR AND no structural level
#:    (computed level with enough touches, or signal-bar edge) on the

#:
#: STRUCTURAL_STOP_TOO_FAR is still DEFINED but is no longer raised by

#: 2026-09-30. It refused a readable structural level sitting further from
#: entry than `1 - STOP_SANITY_FLOOR_FRACTION` (50%), borrowing that
#: fraction from the midday TRAIL_STOP typo guard -- which item 185
#: replaced with a reading off the instrument that this no-ATR branch
#: cannot follow, there being no volatility reading here by construction.
#: The reasoning for deleting rather than re-picking it is at the deletion
#: site in `_widen_stop_past_noise`; in short it is board item 56 route
#: (c)'s ruling applied to the same shape of gate, and the refusal had
#: fired zero times in production. What is NOT true, and was claimed in an
#: earlier version of this note, is that the reward:risk tail still judges
#: the resulting stop in every case: that tail is off for a Type B /
#: breakout trade by design, so on a breakout with no ATR reading nothing
#: judges stop width at all and sizing is the only answer. The name is kept because tests

    # Minimum stop distance, in ATRs. A stop inside ordinary volatility is not
    # a thesis invalidation, it is a coin flip on noise — Phase 3 already
    # established 1.25 ATR as one ordinary day's range for a TRAILING stop,
    # and an entry stop has to survive the whole expected hold, not one
    # session. Measured 2026-08-27: the book's stops sat a median 4.3% below
    # entry against a median ATR of 2.56% of price — about 1.7 ATRs, barely
    # more than a single day. Structure still places the stop; this only
    # pushes it out when structure put it inside the noise.
    # This is a BASE, not a constant. `_stop_atr_multiple` adjusts it per
    # trade — a range setup invalidates inside a defined band and does not
    # need the room a breakout does, and a risk-off tape chops harder than a
    # trending one. ATR itself already adapts the distance to each stock and
    # each session; these adjust how many ATRs that stock's setup deserves.
    #
    # 3.0 -> 1.5 -> 2.5 (2026-09-10). This ONLY applies when no real level
    # backs the stop (see `absolute_min_stop_atr_multiple` below for that
    # case) — the owner's standing rule is that a REAL level is always judged
    # on its own honest distance, never overwritten by this number. This is
    # purely the fallback for trades that have no such level.
    #
    # The 1.5 this replaces was measured (Sweeney MAE) against this desk's
    # own ~2-week trade history — the SAME history whose signals were later
    # found to include seats that misreported confidence and data quality
    # (the "content-honesty" fixes, 2026-09-04/05). That window is too short,
    # too clean a regime (no risk-off), and now of suspect provenance to be
    # the sole basis for a risk-of-ruin number. Not necessarily wrong, just
    # no longer trustworthy as the ONLY input.
    #
    # 2.5 instead comes from published doctrine that does not depend on this
    # desk's own data at all: general swing-trading stop-placement guidance
    # puts a FIXED entry stop at 2.5-3.0x ATR (vs. 1.0x scalping, 1.5-2.0x
    # intraday momentum) for a multi-day hold. QAMC's prompt describes itself
    # as exactly that kind of book (days-to-weeks holds), so 2.5 sits inside
    # that bracket rather than at either edge.
    #
    # Caveat, stated honestly: Chuck LeBeau's Chandelier Exit and Van Tharp's
    # volatility-stop work (also cited in this debate, also 2.0-3.0x) are
    # TRAILING-stop mechanisms — the stop recalculates off each new high, it
    # is not a fixed distance from a static entry. This settings file already
    # flagged, correctly, that applying a trailing-stop multiple to a fixed
    # entry stop plus a hard reward:risk floor is a different, more binding
    # combination than the literature's trailing-stop use case. 2.5 is
    # grounded in the general entry-stop consensus above, not in Chandelier/
    # Tharp specifically — noted so the two aren't conflated later.
    #
    # Known tension, disclosed rather than hidden: `min_reward_risk_after_
    # widening` (1.5) requires roughly `sqrt(H) >= 1.5 x 2.5` to clear
    # (H = hold in sessions), i.e. H >= ~14 sessions. Re-measure once honest
    # post-fix trade history exists.
    #
    # ONE WIDTH FOR EVERY UNBACKED STOP (owner ruling 2026-10-04; mandate
    # 2026-10-09). A stock's stop width comes from that stock's own
    # behaviour -- its ATR -- times this 2.5, and nothing else. The setup
    # scaler (range 0.90) and the macro-regime scalers (risk-off 1.20 /
    # transitional 1.10 / risk-on 0.95) were removed 2026-10-09: none was

    # no-trade sessions instead of right-sized ones.
    #
    # This is the STANDING cap. The ladder-resolved ceiling for the session
    # is passed to `construct_orders` per run, because it depends on live
    # drawdown and a config default cannot know it. Kept in sync with
    # `risk.max_gross_exposure_x` — pipeline.py wires them from the same
    # setting.

    # setup and tape) or the signal bar's edge, whichever is wider, applied
    # ONLY when nothing computed backs the typed stop — and the result is
    # then gated on width. The analyst schema requires a stop on every
    # actionable rating, so "nothing typed" is the rare case, not the norm.
