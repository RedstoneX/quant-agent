"""Portfolio Constructor — turns PM target-state into concrete orders.

Phase 2 of the architecture work. Previously the LLM (Portfolio Manager)
emitted TradeDecision objects directly, including entry_price / stop_loss /
take_profit. That put the LLM dangerously close to the execution layer:
- fat-finger-protection patches
- vol-adjusted sizing patches
- stop-limit buffer patches
- sub-penny quantize patches
...were all band-aids for "LLM output an execution detail it shouldn't own."

Now PM emits TargetPosition (target_weight_pct, conviction, thesis,
invalid_if) and this module derives the actual orders from:
- Target state
- Current positions (broker truth)
- TA's ATR + suggested stop (for stop distance)
- Broker's live price (for entry price)
- Total equity + cash (for sizing)

The constructor is deterministic and unit-testable. LLM creativity is
confined to intent; math is code.

        Orders are returned in a canonical order: exits (SELL/COVER, partials
        and full closes) first, then entries (BUY/SHORT). Execution layer is
        free to re-order, but this matches the existing pipeline assumption
        (exits free up capacity first).

        `price_map`: optional {symbol: live_price} — required for BUYs so
        the constructor can sanity-check TA's entry. If absent for a BUY
        symbol, we fall back to TA's entry_price.

        `unpriceable_symbols`: new names (docs/WORK.md item 120) for which
        the caller's freshness resolver (`src.data.live_price`) could NOT
        obtain a fresh today print this session — a thin name with no print,
        or a feed that returned only a stale print. A mapping SYMBOL ->
        fault code (`FAULT_NO_PRICE` / `FAULT_STALE_PRICE`); a bare set is
        also accepted and defaults every entry to `FAULT_NO_PRICE`. Sizing a
        buy off a stale price (or a quote mid) mis-sizes it proportionally,
        so each of these is refused as a DATA FAULT and dropped rather than
        sized on a bad price OR on the TA entry fallback. It never affects a
        held name: the caller only lists new targets it tried and failed to
        price. `resolve_live_price` returns a real print or today's forming
        session bar and never a quote mid, so an absent value here means no
        usable today price of any kind — not merely "no last trade".

        `existing_risk_pct` / `clusters`: spec §2.2. The book's current
        per-symbol budget risk (`src/risk/metrics.py`) and its measured
        correlation clusters (`src/data/correlation.py`). Supplied together
        they turn the 25% at-risk ceiling from a figure the PM was shown into
        a gate it cannot exceed. Omitted, the portfolio-level ceilings are not
        enforced — the constructor has no view of the book's risk and must not
        invent one — though per-position sizing and the 5% single-name ceiling
        still apply.

        `evidence_registry`: spec §9.4. {symbol: {source: stance}} — the same
        canonical registry `PortfolioManagerAgent.build_evidence_registry`
        built for the PM's own prompt this session (the caller recomputes it
        from the identical inputs; it is a pure function of them, so this is
        guaranteed to agree with what the PM was shown). Drives the agreement
        ceiling in `_plan_risk_targets`. Omitted, that ceiling is not enforced
        — same "no view, don't invent one" posture as `existing_risk_pct`.

        `stale_sources`: spec §9.4 freshness. {symbol: {source}} — registry
        entries that are real coverage but too old to earn size, from
        `PortfolioManagerAgent.stale_evidence_sources` (the same pure function
        the PM's own prompt used, recomputed by the caller from identical
        inputs). Removed from BOTH sides of the agreement tally (a stance too
        stale to corroborate is too stale to dissent), so it can lower a
        ceiling and never raise one. Omitted, nothing is gated — a caller with
        no freshness view must not invent one, exactly as above.

        `non_corroborating_sources`: board item 109. {symbol: {source}} —
        today only a macro stance broadcast onto a name whose sector the
        macro read never mentioned, from
        `PortfolioManagerAgent.broadcast_macro_sources`. A DIFFERENT fact
        from staleness, kept in a DIFFERENT parameter because it has a
        different consequence: it is removed from the ALIGNED side only, so
        it can never manufacture agreement and can never drop a dissent the
        desk should hear. Merging the two mappings would raise the net on
        any name a broad bearish read opposed, admitting trades that are
        refused today — and would file "too stale" as the durable reason for
        a stance that is perfectly current. Omitted, nothing is gated.

        `gross_ceiling`: spec §11.2. The de-levering ladder's resolved
        `GrossCeiling` for this session — the standing cap, stepped down by
        measured peak-to-trough drawdown. Entries are shrunk to fit it, and
        refused outright when what remains is below `min_order_usd`. Omitted,
        the constructor falls back to the standing cap with no drawdown
        applied, so a caller that forgets it still sizes under A ceiling
        rather than none. **This function never trims the held book** — the
        gross ceiling's de-lever is authored in the session preamble, before
        any agent runs, so it cannot depend on a model returning a book.

        `live_stops`: {symbol: live broker stop} for held positions — the
        same stops the heat roll-up behind `existing_risk_pct` is computed
        from. Used ONLY to size a risk-based trim of a held name that has no
        analysis this session (`_held_trim_entry_and_stop`). Omitted, such a
        trim is refused by name and the position is left unchanged.

        `ranking`: retired board item 49, owner decision 2026-09-12 (`docs/INCIDENT_HISTORY.md`, 2026-09-14). The
        session's candidate order, BEST FIRST — the caller passes the symbols
        of `PortfolioManagerAgent.last_candidate_ranking`, i.e. exactly the
        `rank_verdicts` order the PM itself was shown. When the risk budget
        binds it is spent down this order rather than in whatever order the
        allocator happened to iterate. Omitted, the allocator's pre-decision
        ordering applies — no ranking is invented here or there.

        Spec §2.1: `shares = (equity x risk_pct) / |entry - stop|`, which as a
        notional weight is `risk_pct x entry / (entry - stop)`. The equity term
        cancels, so this needs no book value — only the stop distance. A wider
        stop yields a SMALLER position rather than a rejected trade, which is
        what eliminates the "stops too tight" failure class: risk is never
        controlled by squeezing the stop.

        Spec §2.2: the requested risks are rationed against the total and
        per-cluster ceilings before any of them is converted to a size, so the
        book is bounded by construction rather than by a later veto.

        Spec §9.4, as of 2026-09-14: the SIGNED source score — aligned seats
        minus opposed ones (`evidence_registry` + `signed_source_score`) — is
        a REFUSAL GATE and nothing more. A score at or below zero refuses the
        request entirely, so the target produces no order at all; a held
        position is left exactly where it is, because refusing to BUY is not
        a decision to SELL. A score of 1 or more imposes no size restriction:
        the graduated ceiling that used to scale risk by sqrt(net / 5 seats)
        is retired, because that law prices INDEPENDENT estimates and these
        seats read overlapping evidence. See
        `src/risk/rules.py::agreement_refuses_trade`. Agreement still ORDERS
        which candidates get funded first, through `rank_verdicts` and the
        allocator's `priority`.
