"""Portfolio Constructor — turns PM target-state into concrete orders.

Phase 2 of the architecture work. Previously the LLM (Portfolio Manager)
emitted TradeDecision objects directly, including entry_price / stop_loss /
take_profit. That put the LLM dangerously close to the execution layer:
- fat-finger-protection patches
- vol-adjusted sizing patches
- stop-limit buffer patches
- sub-penny quantize patches
...were all band-aids for "LLM output an execution detail it shouldn't own."

Now PM emits TargetPosition (target_weight_pct, conviction, thesis,
invalid_if) and this module derives the actual orders from:
- Target state
- Current positions (broker truth)
- TA's ATR + suggested stop (for stop distance)
- Broker's live price (for entry price)
- Total equity + cash (for sizing)

The constructor is deterministic and unit-testable. LLM creativity is
confined to intent; math is code.

        is decided against the level's own zone, whose width is a

        this question at all. It is still very much an input to whether
        the resulting stop is honoured — see `_widen_stop_past_noise`.

        Spec §12.1. "Verified" means the price came out of
        `src/data/levels.py::find_structural_levels` and was attached to the
        analysis IN PYTHON (`TechAnalysisResult.computed_levels`, set by
        `TechAnalystAgent` after parsing and never emitted by the model). A
        model asserting a level in `support_levels` / `resistance_levels`
        earns nothing here — if it could, it would only have to name a level
        beside its stop to buy itself an exemption from the noise floor,
        and the verification would be worthless.

        Side is judged against THIS ENTRY, not against the last close.
        `find_structural_levels` labels a level support or resistance
        relative to the last close, and its own docstring says a ceiling
        price has broken through becomes a floor. The trade is entered at a

        matters is only whether the level is below entry (it can hold a
        long up) or above it (it can cap a short). This is the same
        re-partition `derive_structural_target` performs for the target,
        for the same reason — see the `levels` note in its docstring.

        Returns the CLOSEST matching level so the log names the one the
        stop is actually sitting on. A level with fewer than
        `risk.min_level_touches_for_stop_honor` prior touches is skipped
        entirely here — it is real enough to register in `computed_levels`
        and to anchor a target, but not (per docs/RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md §7's
        measured table) trusted enough to earn the tight-stop exemption. A
        stop resting on it falls through to the ATR floors below, same as a

             structure stop (IG, LuxAlgo). The shipping stop is placed one
             buffer BEYOND the level (the losing side).
          2. The signal (last completed) bar's low for a long / high for a
             short -- a prior-bar low stop (Ticker Daily), which is also what a
             Donchian channel-low collapses to when only the last bar is

        A trade whose stop had NO level behind it still gets a record, with
        `level_backed` false, because that is the control the falsification
        needs.

        2026-09-26 under board item 56 route (c), the ratified answer being
        to size down instead. No width refusal remains anywhere in this
