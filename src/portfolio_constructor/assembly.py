"""Wiring for `PortfolioConstructor`: builds its two held parts and their delegates.

Construction only -- no behaviour lives here. `hold_parts` gives one
constructor a `StopRules` and an `OrderBuilders`; `install_delegates` puts a
same-named thin shim for every part method on the owner class, so each
existing call site (`constructor._resolve_stop(...)`, `self._build_buy(...)`)
keeps resolving and a name patched on the owner INSTANCE is what the parts see.
Anything that can change after construction is handed in live: the config
through a getter, the entry-builder collaborators and the `EntryStopResolver`
through late-bound callables that read the owner at call time. A part is never
handed the owner's delegate for a body it owns (that would recurse): the
resolver gets `_widen_stop_past_noise` ONLY when the owner's attribute is not
the owner class's own shim for it.
