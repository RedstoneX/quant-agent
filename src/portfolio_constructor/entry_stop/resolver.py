        construction time — same target derivation and stop-widening
        `construct_orders` applies — computed BEFORE a `TargetPosition`
        exists.

        Exists to close a gap found in a 2026-09-04 audit: the 2026-09-01
        decision that reward:risk must be "evidence, never arithmetic"
        (this class's own `_derive_target` / `_widen_stop_past_noise`) was
        applied to order construction but never reached
        `PortfolioManagerAgent.candidate_eligibility` /
        `_apply_subfloor_catalyst_rule` — the EARLIER gate that decides
        which candidates even reach construction. That gate kept reading
        `TechAnalysisResult.risk_reward`, which is real arithmetic but over
        the ANALYST's own guessed target, never checked against structure
        (see that field's docstring). On a measured real day the two gates
        passed disjoint sets — zero overlap — because the first gate
        screened out exactly the names the second would have allowed
        through, and vice versa. This method gives the earlier gate the
        SAME real number the later one uses, by calling the same
        `_derive_target` / `_widen_stop_past_noise` this class already
        runs, rather than a second copy of that logic.

        Two inputs are necessarily earlier-stage approximations, because
        nothing later exists yet at PM eligibility time:
          - entry is the analyst's SNAPSHOT `entry_price`, not the live
            market price `construct_orders` prices the real order at —
            that price does not exist until the PM has decided to trade
            the name.
          - the stop is `analysis.stop_loss`, mirroring `_resolve_stop`'s
            second-priority source. There is no `TargetPosition.
            suggested_stop_price` yet, because the PM has not proposed one.
        Both are re-resolved for real at construction time against the
        live price and (if the PM supplies one) its own suggested stop, so
        a name can still legitimately move between preview and shipped
        order — but it will no longer move because of TWO DIFFERENT
        DEFINITIONS of reward:risk, which is the defect this closes: the
        derived target and the noise-floor stop widening were never
        applied before the PM's gate at all.

        None means "cannot judge" — the same fail-closed contract as
        `_widen_stop_past_noise`, which this calls. As of 2026-09-11
        (docs/WORK.md item 1(d)) it no longer ALSO means "under this desk's
        floor": a real but weak range payoff returns its real number, and a
        breakout returns its number without any floor having been consulted.

        Spec §12.1 (2026-09-01). **A stop sitting at a level the system
        COMPUTED is honoured however tight; the ATR band applies only when
        nothing computed backs it.**

        What this replaced, and why. `min_stop_atr_multiple` used to
        overwrite the structural stop unconditionally whenever the level sat
        closer to entry than the band. After that the stop was not at
        anything real — and `min_reward_risk_after_widening` was then judged
        against that fabricated number, so the reward was being divided by a
        risk nobody would ever take. The arithmetic is unforgiving: over a
        ~15-session hold a stock travels ~3.9 ATR, so against a 3.0-ATR stop
        the best achievable ratio is ~1.29 against a 1.5 floor. Essentially
        no trade could pass, and on 2026-09-01 the desk reviewed 38 qualified
        signals and placed ZERO trades. Tuning the multiple down to 2.0 was
        considered and explicitly REJECTED by the owner: it keeps a floor
        that still cannot tell a level-backed tight stop from an arbitrary
        one. Neither threshold moved. What changed is WHICH stop the
        arithmetic is performed on.

        "Verified" is doing real work here — see `_level_backing_stop`. The
        level must have come out of `find_structural_levels` and been
        attached in Python. A stop the analyst merely placed close, with
        nothing computed under it, still gets the full band.

        **The 1x ATR floor below is an addition beyond the ratified §12.1
        wording, and it is deliberate.** §12.1 argues the exemption is safe
        because `config/prompts/tech_analyst.md` already forbids a stop
        inside 1*ATR of entry. That is a PROMPT — an instruction to a
        language model — and Invariant 2 of the spec requires deterministic
        Python protections to be the final authority and to fail closed. A
        prompt is not a deterministic guarantee. Meanwhile a genuine support
        level sitting 0.2 ATR under entry is real structure AND a guaranteed
        whipsaw; both things are true at once. So a level-backed stop is
        honoured however tight DOWN TO `absolute_min_stop_atr_multiple`
        ATRs, and inside that it is widened to exactly that floor — never to
        the full `min_stop_atr_multiple` band, which is the behaviour being
        removed.

        For an unbacked stop nothing has changed: it is pushed out to
        `min_stop_atr_multiple` ATRs, exactly as before. That corrects the
        case the evidence says was routine — stops a median 1.7 ATRs from
        entry, a coin flip on a normal day's range rather than a thesis
        invalidation, which then forced enormous positions to reach any
        meaningful risk. This never invents a stop where none exists, and
        never pulls a wide stop tighter.

        D5 (Stage 3): direction-aware. A long's stop is pushed DOWN, away
        from entry; a short's stop is pushed UP, away from entry, by the
        same number of ATRs — mirrored, not reflected through a different
        rule. A computed reward:risk on a widened short is ranking
        information, not a refusal, exactly as for a long.

        **2026-09-11, docs/WORK.md item 1 part (d) — this function no longer
        REFUSES anything on reward:risk.** Owner decision, by setup type:

          * **Type B / trend** — no reward:risk comparison runs at all.
            Nothing overhead is expected to stop the stock; the position is
            managed by a trailing stop with no fixed target
            (`src/risk/trailing.py`), so the only number available to put in
            the numerator is invented to make the ratio computable. Decided
            by `src.risk.constants.is_trend_trade`, which accepts EITHER the
            analyst's `setup_type="breakout"` label OR
            `structural_ceiling=False` — the desk's own level computation
            having found nothing in this trade's direction. The caller
            supplies that measured fact from the same `_derive_target`
            derivation it already ran, so this exemption and
            `derive_structural_target`'s measured-move projection turn on one
            shared definition rather than two that can drift.
          * **Type A / range** — the ratio is still computed from this
            trade's own real support (the shipping stop) and real resistance
            (`_derive_target`). A computed result is never a refusal and is
            never a size-cap (owner 2026-09-17). It reaches ranking as a
            real ordering signal (`real_reward_risk_preview` ->
            `src/verdicts.py::rank_verdicts`).

        What still refuses, unchanged: every RISK-side check above — a
        wrong-side stop, a non-finite stop or entry. An UNMEASURABLE ratio
        is recorded, not refused (owner 2026-09-17 overnight bind: honesty
        about a payoff without a number is a ranking hint, not a gate).
        `subfloor_catalyst_exception` is inert theater around a dead floor
        and does not admit, refuse, or resize anything.

        `target_price` (2026-09-01) is the DERIVED target — computed from
        structure by `_derive_target`. It has to be passed in rather than
        read off the analysis, because the whole point of the change is that
        `analysis.reference_target` is the language model's guess and this
        gate is arithmetic. When it is omitted the old read is kept, for the
        one caller that legitimately supplies its own structural target: the
        backtest engine, which computes the nearest level itself and hands it
        over on a shim (`src/backtest/engine.py`). That path was never
        exposed to the defect.

        **2026-09-12, docs/WORK.md item 54 — the width gate, and a stop
        that is always derivable.** Sourced research (Bulkowski on gaps,
        George & Hwang 2004 on nearness to the 52-week high, Kullamägi's
        own stop discipline) falsified the one-day "no floor, no trade"
        rule: what published practice constrains is the stop's WIDTH, not
        whether a level exists under it. So: (1) an unbacked stop is placed
        at the wider of the noise band and the signal bar's far edge, both
        read from the instrument; (2) a missing stop is placed the same way
        rather than refused; (3) whatever placed the stop, a width past the
        instrument's own reach over the trade's horizon was REFUSED by code
        (`STOP_REFUSAL_WIDER_THAN_REACH`). **That refusal was DELETED on
        2026-09-26 (board item 56, route (c)) after refusing nothing in 648
        recorded sized stops** — this function no longer refuses on distance
        at all. Width is answered by `_plan_risk_targets` sizing down
        (§2.1); `STOP_RULE_OUTSIDE_BAND` still keeps a wide typed stop.

        **2026-09-02 — the reward:risk floor now runs on EVERY path, not
        only when this function moved the stop.** It previously lived
        inside the two widening branches, behind two unnamed early returns
        ("already outside the noise band", "no ATR reading"). A stop that
        was already wide enough therefore reached the broker with NO
        deterministic reward:risk check at all, and the name
        `min_reward_risk_after_widening` recorded that as if it were the
        design. It was not caught because it fails OPEN and quietly.

        Measured against the pre-reset production database
        (`data/resets/20260902T181859Z`), 2026-08-18 to 2026-09-02:
        **14 of the 49 constructed entry orders — 29% — shipped with a
        reward:risk below the 1.5 floor**, as low as 0.43 (XLB,
        2026-09-02) and 0.50 (NET, 2026-08-27). The floor's own refusal
        message appears ZERO times in the whole production log history
        before 2026-09-02. Two of the 14 reached the broker; XLE on
        2026-08-21 FILLED, 9 shares at $64.26, on a reward:risk of 0.81.
        Everything else was stopped downstream by the Risk Manager — a
        language model — or by the 1.2 execution-time belt in
        `src/pipeline_stages.py`. A deterministic floor was being enforced
        by an LLM's prose, which is exactly the inversion Invariant 2
        forbids.

        So the ratio is now measured against the stop that will ship,
        whichever rule placed it, and refused by a code naming that rule.
        The threshold did not move and no path became more permissive.
