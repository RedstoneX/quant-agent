"""Exit order builders — sell, cover and hold legs of the Portfolio Constructor.

Pure functions of their arguments (no collaborators): the host's thin shims
delegate straight to the staticmethods here.
Standalone piece: it takes no collaborators, so it builds and runs without a `PortfolioConstructor` or a
`TradingPipeline` behind it (clauses 1-5 of tests/boundary_harness.py).
Method bodies moved VERBATIM from src/portfolio_constructor/orders.py; the
same-named thin shims there build this object per call."""
