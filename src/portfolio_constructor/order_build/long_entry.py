"""Long entry builder — the `_build_buy` leg of the Portfolio Constructor.

Standalone piece: every collaborator is an explicit keyword-only constructor
argument, so it builds and runs without a `PortfolioConstructor` or a
`TradingPipeline` behind it (clauses 1-5 of tests/boundary_harness.py).
Method bodies moved VERBATIM from src/portfolio_constructor/orders.py; the
same-named thin shims there build this object per call."""
