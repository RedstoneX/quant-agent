"""Counted rows for every no-ATR structural stop placement (board item 90).

`ConstructorConfig.structural_stop_buffer_pct` (0.5%) is filed `arbitrary`:
owner appetite, not doctrine. Its only consumer is
`StopRules._derive_structural_stop_no_atr`, the branch the desk takes when a
name arrives with no ATR(14) reading and the protective stop has to be read
off price STRUCTURE instead (owner ruling 2026-09-25, board item 80).

Nothing has ever counted that branch, so two questions about it cannot be
answered from the record at all:

  * How OFTEN does it run? The ledger note says the branch is NEVER
    EXERCISED on the committed daily-bar fixture (1197 windows, 7 symbols,
    an ATR in all of them) -- which is a statement about a fixture, not
    about the live desk.
  * When it runs, is the level's MEASURED cluster half-width present? That
    half-width is the only candidate denominator that could replace the flat
    percentage with something read off the name itself. If it is routinely
    absent, the flat percentage stays and the ledger says so.

NOTHING CHANGES BEHAVIOUR HERE. `noted` is handed the placement the caller
already decided and hands it straight back; `nothing_found` returns None,
which is exactly what the caller returns without it. No stop moves, no
level is re-chosen, no buffer is re-expressed. The 2026-10-04 ruling that
money numbers be expressed per stock is NOT applied to this buffer here:
re-expressing it tightens the stop on a quiet name, protection changes are
one-way, and doing that on a path whose frequency nobody has measured is
the trap this module exists to close.

THE ROUTE, NAMED HONESTLY. There is no stored field for this. Each row is
one `logger.info` line on the portfolio-constructor package logger
(`src.portfolio_constructor.config.logger` -- the same handle
`stops.py` itself logs through, and the same handle
`absolute_floor_record.py` writes its `ABS_FLOOR_ROW` rows through),
carrying a stable `NO_ATR_STOP_ROW ` prefix and a JSON payload. `rows_from`
parses those lines back and `summarise` computes every total from them at
read time. There is deliberately NO module-level tally and no reset: a
running count is stored bookkeeping, it cannot be re-sliced or audited, and
it would let one session inherit another's numbers.

Three states stay distinguishable, which is the whole point:

  * no row at all                 -- the branch was NEVER REACHED
  * a row with outcome `level`    -- tier 1 placed the stop off a verified
                                     computed structural level
  * a row with outcome `prior_bar` -- tier 2 placed it off the signal bar
  * a row with outcome `none`     -- the branch ran and found no usable
                                     structure on the protective side
