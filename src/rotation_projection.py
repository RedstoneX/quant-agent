    """The held book and the equity as they will be once THIS SESSION'S
    exits have gone through — the state the downstream gates will actually
    read, projected before any of them has been submitted.

    Board item 39. The gates that can refuse a rotation's replacement BUY
    are measured from the book the desk will be holding once the sale has
    gone through, not the one it holds while proposing it: the deployment
    budget reads the remaining positions' gross exposure and the remaining
    settled cash, and the sizing reads the equity those are measured
    against. A check fed PRE-sale state is blind to the state change it
    depends on, which is exactly why attempt 2 on this item was unsafe by
    construction, and why this builds the post-sale book instead of
    re-implementing the gates against the pre-sale one.

    **Exactly the exits it is handed are applied, and no others.** The
    rotation gate hands it ONE decision — the rotation's own close — and
    relies on a fresh `_refresh_account_state()` read for everything else
    the session has already done. Projecting the other exits would be
    guessing at fills nobody controls; measuring them is free, because the
    rotation's close is ordered last.

    Returns `(projected_positions, equity_for_weights)`.

      * `equity_for_weights` is `total_value` LESS the concession the
        marketable limits give up against the marks (0.995 for a SELL, its
        1.005 COVER mirror). A sale is otherwise mark-to-market neutral: it
        converts a marked position into the cash that position was already
        marked at, so the book's composition changes and its total does
        not. The concession is the one real equity effect of executing, it
        is knowable, and it is subtracted rather than ignored.
        **Direction, measured rather than assumed (adversary review,
        2026-09-23).** `config/settings.yaml` ships `allow_margin: true`, so
        `_entry_deployment_budget` returns `ceiling_x * equity - held_gross`
        and never reads cash at all. The order ceiling therefore falls by
        between 0.65 and 2.0 times any reduction in equity (the §11.2 rung
        and `max_position_pct: 65`), while the replacement's estimated cost
        falls only by the allocation percentage of it. Subtracting the
        concession TIGHTENS this gate; leaving it out loosens it. An
        earlier version of this docstring asserted the opposite and was
        wrong — it reasoned about the settled-cash branch, which the
        shipped configuration does not execute.

    Cover decisions are applied the same way: a COVER closes a short, which
    also removes that name from the held book.
