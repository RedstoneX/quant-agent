"""One durable row per order ATTEMPT (submit accepted, rejected, unknown, cancel).

Why: docs/FUTURE.md's erratic-behaviour breaker needs "orders per minute" and
"trades per hour", and before this nothing counted orders at all. This records
what the execution stage already knows at the moment an outcome is known; it
adds no behaviour and nothing in the desk reads it yet.

The `client_order_id` column is READ from the order payload the broker
adapter returned (never derived here). The desk does send a deterministic key on
entry and stop submissions (src/execution/order_idempotency.py), but the adapter
does not surface it in the dict it returns, so the column is NULL on every row
until it does: nothing is fabricated.
