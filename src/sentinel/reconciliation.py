"""The most recent reconciliation result, per reconciler kind.

Why: docs/FUTURE.md's heartbeat carries "last reconciliation", and until now
the reconcilers wrote back fixes but kept no record of WHEN they last ran or
WHETHER broker and ledger agreed. One row per run is appended; `status()`
reports 'agreed', 'disagreed' or 'not_run' -- the third is never collapsed
into either of the others. Nothing in the desk reads this yet.

    Why this exists: a broad ``except Exception`` on the trading path is
    there on purpose — removing it can turn a recoverable miss into a crash
    mid-order — but as written most of them record a one-line message with
    no traceback, so a programming error (a TypeError from an argument
    passed twice, an AttributeError from a renamed field) is indistinguishable
    from a quiet no-op. This makes the handler LOUD without changing what it
    does: full traceback at ERROR, plus one counted row on the EXISTING
    reconciliation channel. It never re-raises and never returns anything the
    caller branches on.

    Three states stay distinct, which is the whole point:
      * ``not_run``   — this site was never reached (no row at all)
      * ``agreed``    — it ran and swallowed nothing (``exc=None``)
      * ``disagreed`` — it ran and swallowed a fault (``exc`` set)

    `log` is the caller's module logger when given, so the traceback lands
    under the module that owns the handler rather than under this one, and
    `context` carries the per-name facts (symbol, row, order id) that the
    one-line log it replaces used to carry, into the counted row itself.
