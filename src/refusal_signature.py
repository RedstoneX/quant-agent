"""Escalate when the desk refuses every idea for the SAME reason, session
after session — the shape of a jammed gate, not of a quiet market.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES (docs/WORK.md item 59)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every individual empty day is already reported honestly and distinctly:
`no_trades`, `no_orders` and `buys_unfunded` are three separate status
words for three different kinds of nothing (`src/pipeline.py`,
`src/notifier.py`), and after 2026-09-13 every single-day path by which the
desk can produce nothing has an alarm behind it (docs/INCIDENT_HISTORY.md,
"can the desk still die quietly?"). Nothing watched the SEQUENCE. A gate
defect that refused every candidate would tell the truth each morning,
never raise its voice, and stay invisible for as long as it lasted — and
the measured record shows 6 zero-fill sessions out of 11 in the window the
census examined, so a run of empty days is the ORDINARY state here, not an
exotic one.

WHY THIS INTRODUCES NO DAY COUNT
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The tempting alarm — "N identical empty days" — was ruled out on the spot:
there is no honest way to read N off anything. N would be invented, and an
invented number is exactly what this desk refuses to ship
(docs/WORK.md, the no-arbitrary-numbers principle).

A jam and a quiet market are separable by SHAPE instead. A quiet market
kills different candidates for different reasons: this one has no usable
structure, that one's reward:risk is thin, another is too young to
measure. A jammed gate kills EVERY candidate with the SAME reason, and
goes on doing it while the candidates underneath it change. So the trigger
is stated entirely in terms the evidence answers by itself:

    every candidate, in every consecutive no-entry session back to the
    last session that ended any other way, was refused by ONE reason —
    the same one — while the set of candidates was NOT the same set each
    time.

There is no threshold in that sentence. The run of sessions is bounded by
the data (it ends at the last session that did something else). "The
candidate set was not the same set each time" is what forces more than one
session to be involved — you cannot observe "the reason did not vary" from
a single observation, and you cannot observe "the input varied" from
identical inputs. Nothing here is tuned, and nothing was fitted to the
desk's own history.

WHAT COUNTS AS "THE REASON"
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The durable `pipeline_event` rows `src/pipeline_stages.py` writes for every
candidate (read today by `scripts/blocked_proposals_census.py` and by the
evening blocked-proposals digest in `src/pipeline.py`). Each carries
`stage`, `outcome`, `reason`, and — for the two paths that record a refusal
AS DATA rather than recovering it from a log line — a named `refusal` or
`fault` code beside a human detail string.

Two normalisations make those keys comparable ACROSS symbols, and both are
mechanical, not judgemental:

  * the candidate's own ticker is removed from the text (several reasons
    are the constructor's own log line, which opens with the symbol), and
  * every numeric literal is replaced by a placeholder, so "reward:risk
    1.12 below the floor" and "reward:risk 1.31 below the floor" are one
    reason, which they are.

Both can only ever MERGE two reasons that are really the same rule. They
can never split one rule into two — so the failure mode of this normaliser
is a missed alarm, never a false one. Where a reason mentions a SECOND
symbol (sector crowding names the position it collides with), the keys stay
distinct and this check stays quiet. That is a known and deliberate
false-negative, recorded here rather than papered over.

The key is taken from the LAST event recorded for that candidate in that
run, not from an allow-list of "refusal" outcomes. An allow-list rots the
moment a new gate is added; "what killed it last" cannot.

WHAT IS NOT A REFUSAL (2026-09-22, the false alert this closes)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
"What killed it last" is only true of an event that KILLED it. Two kinds of
last event kill nothing, and reading either as a refusal is how the owner
came to be told that the desk had refused every idea for the same reason
across six intraday ticks that never ran a gate at all:

  * a last event whose outcome is in `NOT_A_REFUSAL_OUTCOMES` did not turn
    an idea down. Either it records the candidate ARRIVING somewhere with
    nothing yet ruled (`UNDECIDED_OUTCOMES` — the desk found it, a
    specialist looked at it, a seat nominated it), or something DID rule and
    ruled that no new entry was right (`NO_ENTRY_DECIDED_OUTCOMES` — the
    portfolio manager holding a position it still rates, a nomination that
    duplicates an analysis this run already has, an exit). Such a candidate
    is dropped from the run's evidence; a run left with none of them is
    absent from the session list entirely. The second of those two is the
    fully-invested book, and it is not a defect: a decision to hold is the
    gate working.
  * a run the desk's OWN report row says stopped before the decision stage
    (`NON_DECIDING_STATUSES`: the cost circuit suspending paid analysis, the
    evidence gate skipping, a crash on the way in) is not evidence about the
    gate in either direction. It is stepped over: it neither joins a streak
    nor breaks one, because a jam does not clear just because one tick was
    switched off, and a switched-off tick is not proof of a jam either.

The two are separate rules on purpose, and neither subsumes the other. The
17:15–19:45 ticks of 2026-09-22 are caught by the first (their only events
were `opportunity|discovered`); the 15:15 tick the same afternoon is caught
only by the second, because it ran its specialists first and one of them
failed, leaving a last event that does read as a disposition.

CADENCE, AND WHY IT CANNOT PAGE A PAUSED DESK
------------------------------------------------------------------------
At most one alert per trading day while the condition holds — docs/WORK.md
item 41's existing ruling, already used by `src/coverage_watchdog.py`. No
new cadence is invented here.

And the streak must be CURRENT: the newest session in it has to fall on the
most recent completed trading day, judged by the same
`coverage_watchdog.most_recent_trading_day` the stop watchdog uses. The
trading timers were paused on 2026-09-03. A paused desk runs no sessions,
so its newest session is not on the most recent trading day, so this check
is silent — a deliberately paused desk is not a defect. It re-arms itself
with no flag to flip the moment sessions resume, because that is the same
moment the newest session becomes current again.

WHERE IT RUNS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
From `scripts/alert_heartbeat.py`, beside the coverage watchdog: the one
unit that fires daily whether or not the trading timers are enabled. It is
a READER — one read-only SQLite connection, one owner alert, no writes to
the trading database and no broker orders of any kind.

#: `outcome` values that record a candidate ARRIVING somewhere rather than a

#: it as a terminal outcome is how the owner was told on 2026-09-22 that the
#: desk had "refused" six intraday ticks' worth of movers whose only recorded
#: event was that the desk had FOUND them (`opportunity|discovered` — SNDK
#: moved 6.69% past the 3% discovery threshold and nothing then ran).
#:
#: This is a SET, not a special case for one string, because `opportunity`
#: is not the only stage with that character and `opportunity` is not
#: uniformly of it: the same stage also writes `already_covered`, which IS a
#: terminal disposition ("we hold it already"), while `specialist|evaluated`
#: — a different stage entirely — is just as much a beginning as
#: `discovered` is. So the property belongs to the OUTCOME word, which is
#: what says whether anything ruled, and not to the stage it was written at.
#:
#: A candidate whose last event is one of these has no terminal outcome at
#: all, and is dropped from that run's evidence. It is not counted as
#: refused and it is not counted as survived; the desk simply never got as
#: far as having an opinion about it.
UNDECIDED_OUTCOMES = frozenset({

})

#: Outcomes where something DID rule, and ruled that no new entry was the
#: right answer — for reasons that are not a gate turning an idea down.
#:
#: This is the third category, and it exists because the other two cannot
#: hold `held_unchanged` without breaking something:
#:
#:  * It is not a REFUSAL. The portfolio manager holds the position, still
#:    rates it, and deliberately left it out of the target list because the
#:    right action was none. That is the gate WORKING. Reading it as a
#:    refusal is why a book at 1.99x against a 2.0x ceiling — this desk,
#:    today, with twelve `held_unchanged` rows and no orders — was about to
#:    be reported to the owner as a jammed gate.
#:  * It is not a SURVIVAL either, and putting it in `SURVIVED_OUTCOMES` was
#:    the tempting one-word fix. It would have been worse than the bug. A
#:    single surviving candidate ENDS the streak outright, so on a fully
#:    invested book — where every session carries held names — this alarm
#:    could never fire again, including on a gate that really was stuck. A
#:    full book is exactly when a jam is hardest to see by eye.
#:
#: So a candidate that ends here is dropped from the run's evidence, the
#: same mechanical treatment an undecided one gets and for a different
#: reason: it is a decision, but it is not a decision ABOUT a gate refusing
#: an idea. Twelve held names and nothing else means the run is absent and
#: nothing is sent; twelve held names beside five new candidates all killed
#: by one stuck rule still leaves those five, monomorphic, and the alarm
#: still fires. That is the whole point of choosing this category.
