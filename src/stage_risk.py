        `RiskVerdict.reasoning_chain.event_risk` is a REQUIRED narrative field
        asking whether earnings or a macro release land in the next few
        sessions. Nothing fetched either fact before this: the earnings-date
        lookup (`MarketDataProvider.get_next_earnings_date`) had no callers
        anywhere, and no macro calendar existed — so a mandatory risk check was
        being answered from the model's recollection.

        Earnings are looked up for exactly the symbols RM is judging (this
        run's decisions), bounded per-symbol AND in aggregate so a stalled
        yfinance call can never delay the session. The macro calendar is REUSED
        from the research stage (`ctx.macro_events`) so one session issues one
        FRED sweep, and the FOMC schedule the same way (`ctx.fomc_meetings`),
        so one session issues one Fed calendar fetch; on a resume lane where
        research never ran, ctx carries its "not fetched" defaults and the
        block says exactly that.

        Never raises and never returns an empty string: on any failure the seat
