"""Seat-evidence helpers (split out of src/pipeline_stages.py).

Moved VERBATIM out of `src/pipeline_stages.py`, following the pattern of
`src/pipeline_candidate_records.py`: the nomination-to-decision join, the
per-seat stance rows, the raw seat-nomination gather, the dual-shape macro
read and its parse-failure stash, the risk seat's per-symbol `risk` event
and edit snapshot, the advisory-only `scale_all_buys` record, and the SEC
sale-census probe. Every function takes what it needs as plain arguments, so
each can be exercised with stand-ins and no `TradingPipeline` is ever built
here (`tests/test_boundary_pipeline_seat_evidence.py` is the clause-5
witness). Every moved name is re-exported from `src.pipeline_stages` through
its one lazy re-export table, so each original import path and each test
patch target is unchanged; the write-through mirror on that module keeps a
patched name the same object on both sides.

The shared names below are imported FROM `src.pipeline_stages` as the stage
modules do; `src.pipeline_stages` imports this module only lazily, by name,
so the graph stays acyclic. Not in `src.number_sources.SCOPED_PATHS` on
purpose: the block carries no ledgered number site, so `number_sources.py`
is not grown for nothing. This module must not import `src.pipeline`.

    broadcast onto a name whose sector the macro read never mentioned. The
