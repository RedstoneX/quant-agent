"""Per-run context + structured PM facts.

Previously `TradingPipeline` stashed cross-stage data on its own instance
(``self._last_symbols_bars``, ``self._bg_threads``). That conflated per-run
state with the long-lived service container, making runs non-reentrant,
hard to test, and hard to reason about when one stage's output is
another stage's input.

`RunContext` is an explicit container created at the start of each run.
Every stage reads from it and writes to it by field name. Stages become
functions of ``(ctx, deps) -> ctx-with-fields-filled-in`` rather than
methods that rely on implicit attributes of the enclosing instance.

This module ships the dataclass only — it does not (yet) refactor the
pipeline into explicit stages. That's Phase 2 of the architecture work.
For Phase 1 the goal is just to remove implicit state and give each run
its own mutable snapshot.
