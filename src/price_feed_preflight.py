"""Prove the price feed reads before a session places any new entry.

Owner ruling 2026-10-08: a desk that cannot read price cannot trade. Before
the entry stage sizes anything, ONE read of a reference symbol -- the desk's
configured cash vehicle, never an approved entry -- must come back
(absence is fine: the feed answered). The read carries the broker's own
retry; when it still fails the session places no new entries, every approved
entry is recorded as skipped under ``price_feed_unreadable``, and the fault is
counted durably. Existing positions are not touched by any of this.

`price_feed_session_start` runs at the stage's start, `preflight_price_feed`
on the approved entries before the viability preflight.

`wait_for_today_prints` is the other half of the same ruling, restated by the
owner the same day: "this is a swing trading desk, not scalping. The desk can
keep re-asking until a price is received. It should not be hammered because
that will get us banned." Names with no today print are held in a waiting set
and re-asked for in ONE batched latest-trades request for every waiting name,
on a rising backoff, until each prints or the session's own slot ends. A
failed batch is never a feed fault by itself: the reference symbol decides.

    the feed is down: one bad symbol can fail the whole request. The feed is

    timeout, with the policy's backoff between them. An ask (or the
