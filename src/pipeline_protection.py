"""Protective stops and broker reconciliation: everything that places, cancels,
restores or reconciles a protective stop or a sell against the broker.

Step 2 of `docs/PIPELINE_SPLIT_PLAN.md` (board item 210). Moved verbatim out of
`src/pipeline.py` as a mixin, so `TradingPipeline` keeps every one of these as
its own attribute and every test that patches or calls them is untouched.

This is the live-money code: the stop-coverage reconciler, the repair path, the
protected sell, the write-ahead cancel/restore legs, the repeg and restore
drains, the residual re-protection after a partial sell, the fill/stop-out
reconcilers, and `_handle_ex_dividends` -- which the plan REASSIGNED here out of
step 1's prompt-facts cluster because it shifts live stops down by the dividend
(plan S1 correction, 2026-10-01). A stop-moving method does not belong in a
module advertised as read-only.

The module-level helpers travel with it: `_WAL_SELL_SENTINEL`,
`_market_is_open_now`, `_price_is_through_stop`, `_position_notional`,
`_classify_coverage_gap`, `_reconciled_exit_action` and the broker-fill float
coercion `_finite_float_or_none`. All are re-exported from `src.pipeline` so
`from src.pipeline import ...` keeps working -- but a test that PATCHES one of
them on `src.pipeline` no longer reaches this module's code and must patch it
here instead (plan S5, silent-behaviour risk 1).

Nothing here may import `src.pipeline`: this module is one of its bases.

Five pieces now live as standalone classes under `src/protection/` (owner alerts,
sell finalisation, fill reconciliation, the repeg drain, coverage election),
each built from explicit keyword-only collaborators; the mixin keeps a thin
same-named shim per method, so callers and patch targets are unchanged. The
helpers `_price_is_through_stop`, `_position_notional`, `_finite_float_or_none`,
`_reconciled_exit_action` and `_WAL_SELL_SENTINEL` moved with them and are
imported back here, so `src.pipeline_protection.<name>` still resolves. What
stayed: everything that imports the broker seam (`src.execution`, a frozen
importer list), everything reading `_market_is_open_now`/`et_today` that tests
patch on this module, and the protected sell with its write-ahead cancel, which
hands `_last_stop_clear_refusal` between two methods through the pipeline.

2026-10-04: those followed too. `ProtectedSell` and `ReprotectRecords` live under
`src/protection/`. `CoverageRepair`, `ExitRelief`, `RestoreDrain` and `ExDividends`
import the broker seam (`src.execution`, a frozen importer list) so they stay HERE
as standalone classes built the same way, as does `ReprotectResidual` (over the
400-line ceiling for a new file). Every builder reads the host LIVE per call; host
attributes a body assigns or reads with a default go through `_HostState`, never a
copy. `_reconcile_stop_coverage` keeps its body on the mixin under its original
identity until PR 1223 (which uncrams one of its lines) lands; the statement-cram
ratchet keys by class.method and would read the move as a new crammed line.

2026-10-09: `CoverageRepair`, `RestoreDrain`, `ExDividends` and `ReprotectResidual` moved
verbatim to `src/protection_parts/` (that residual method's existing-stops loop to
`reprotect_scan.py`) to bring this file under its line ceiling; their lazy broker-seam
imports moved with them. The builders and `ProtectionMixin` stay here and import them back,
so `src.pipeline_protection.<Class>` still resolves. `ExDividends` now takes its clock as a
`today` collaborator, which `_build_ex_dividends` reads from this module at call time.

    """Is the regular cash session open RIGHT NOW?

    Spec §11.1 hybrid fractional stops. This is the discriminator the
    whole alerting distinction rests on: a fractional DAY stop that is
    absent while the market is SHUT is the design working — it lapsed at
    16:00 ET exactly as intended and the next session re-places it. The
    same stop absent while the market is OPEN is a placement failure and
    must wake somebody.

    Delegates to `src.market_session.market_open_verdict` — the single answer
    shared with the coverage watchdog. FAILS TOWARD "OPEN" ON PURPOSE. Every way this can be wrong has an
    asymmetric cost: believing the market is shut when it is open would
    SUPPRESS a real naked-position alert, which is the one failure this
    desk cannot absorb. Believing it is open when it is shut costs a
    redundant banner. So anything unknown, unreadable or unexpected
    answers True, and only a confident, positively-established "outside
    the session" answers False.

    The session-window table (`trading_calendar.SESSION_WINDOWS`) is the
    weekday 09:30-16:00 ET baseline; `broker.get_session_close()`
    tightens it on early-close days (Thanksgiving Friday 13:00, July 3),
    and is best-effort — a calendar failure leaves the baseline answer
    rather than inventing a closed market.

    Note the callers all sit behind `_is_trading_day()`, so a holiday
    never reaches here; the weekday check is belt-and-braces for a
    direct call.

    Market hours are deliberately NOT an input here. This answers only
    "what is missing"; the caller decides what that means at this hour.

        At session entry, enumerate every held position — long or short —
        and compare its held qty against the qty actually covered by its
        open protective stops at the broker (SELL-stops for a long,
        BUY-stops for a short). Flag (log + return) any position whose
        covered qty is materially below its held qty.

        Why this exists (design review's strongest finding): the whole
        naked-protection guarantee otherwise rests on some code path having
        successfully persisted a WAL recovery row. A position that goes naked
        WITHOUT a row — a best-effort persist that silently failed, a manual
        broker action, a future SELL path that skips a step — is never
        re-detected, because the WAL is a log of INTENDED operations, not an
        audit of ACTUAL broker coverage. This reconciler closes that gap by
        reading broker truth directly.

        Auto-repairing for longs AND shorts (see `_repair_stop_coverage` —
        it reconstructs the stop from the recorded opening row: BUY for a
        long, SHORT for a short). Inventing a level is still refused when
        that row has none; the SHORT row stores `stop_loss` the same way
        BUY does, so the old "no recorded entry for a short" objection is
        false.

        Symbols already queued for WAL recovery are skipped — the drain owns
        them. Returns the list of under-covered ``{symbol, held_qty,
        covered_qty, coverage, repaired}`` for the caller to surface to the
        operator.

        SPEC §11.1 HYBRID FRACTIONAL STOPS — this sweep is also the
        re-placement mechanism, and the alerting distinction lives here.

        A fractional position is covered by two orders: a durable GTC stop
        over floor(qty) and a DAY stop over the sub-share remainder, which
        the broker expires at 16:00 ET by design. That means "held qty
        exceeds covered qty" is now THREE different situations, not one, and
        reporting them identically would be the worst possible outcome — a
        nightly red banner on an expected state teaches the owner to ignore
        the banner that must never be ignored:

          (a) the durable GTC leg is intact, only the sub-share remainder is
              uncovered, and the market is SHUT. Expected. Stamped
              ``coverage='fractional_overnight'`` with ``uncovered_qty`` and
              ``unprotected_value`` so the exposure is a NUMBER the owner can
              read. No repair (a DAY order into a shut market is a rejection
              at best), no banner, no escalation.
          (b) the same shortfall while the market is OPEN. A placement
              failure. Repaired in place; if the repair lands it is stamped
              ``'fractional_replaced'`` — this is the ordinary start-of-
              session heartbeat and stays quiet — and if it does NOT land it
              falls back onto guard 3's existing ladder and alerts exactly as
              before.
          (c) the whole-share GTC leg is missing or short. Never suppressed,
              never reclassified, market hours irrelevant: 'none' escalates
              to the owner, 'partial' banners. Unchanged from guard 3.

        The three §11.1 guards are extended by this, not replaced: the retry
        burst (guard 1) now runs over each hybrid leg, the owner alert (guard
        2) still fires on a genuine partial cover, and this sweep still
        separates NO STOP AT ALL from STOP MIS-SIZED (guard 3).

    #: stage and the cash sweep — rather than by remembering to flag each one.
