        move away — the evening report's "close to its stop" line.

        "Close" is read off the instrument, never picked: the yardstick is
        the symbol's own ATR(14) (`_atr_for_symbol`, the same measure the
        trailing-stop noise band uses). A position is listed when the gap
        between the last price and the live broker stop is smaller than one
        ATR, i.e. a single ordinary session could reach it. No percentage
        threshold is invented anywhere in this method.

        A symbol whose stop or ATR cannot be read is returned with
        ``status='unknown'`` rather than dropped: silently omitting it would
        render as "nothing is near its stop", which is not what was
        measured. Never raises — any failure degrades to [].
