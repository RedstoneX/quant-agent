        The LLM-producing path is `run_earnings_preprocess()`, which runs
        pre-market (08:00-09:15 ET) and synchronously analyzes + confirms
        every new 10-Q/10-K. By the time morning/midday/evening fire, the
        authoritative result is already on disk.

        This method returns:
          - cached analyses for any filing already confirmed by preprocess
          - placeholder `queued=True` entries for filings that preprocess
            missed (e.g. preprocess didn't run, or the filing dropped after
            preprocess but before a later session). PM sees these and sizes
            down accordingly — better than blocking the session on an LLM.

        No background threads, no session-time token spend. The
        `run_id` + `session` + `ctx` signature is preserved for
        compatibility with MorningResearchStage's callable injection.
