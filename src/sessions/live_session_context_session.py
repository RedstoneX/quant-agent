        2026-09-14 (docs/INCIDENT_HISTORY.md, ORCL 2026-09-10): the morning
        Tech pass compared price against levels using bars that end at the
        PREVIOUS close, so a stock that opened below its support still
        read as above it. This supplies the live price for the same
        seats, from the broker snapshot the intraday scan already uses
        (`get_intraday_snapshots` — no new data source).

        - Outside regular hours: {} — completed bars ARE current (after the
          close today's bar is complete; pre-market/weekend the last close
          is the latest price that exists).
        - In session: one bulk snapshot, resolved through
          `src.data.live_price.resolve_live_price`. A symbol with no print
          from TODAY on any of the snapshot's three print-derived fields
          gets `{"live_unavailable": reason}` and a WARNING — rendered as an
          explicit STALE label, never silently replaced by yesterday, and
          never replaced by a quote mid.
        Never raises.

        2026-09-20, board item 120: this used to read `last_price` alone. On
        2026-09-17 that cost 8 of 104 names their technical seat at the open
        while today's forming bar in the SAME payload already held the open,
        because a thin name's `latest_trade` can still be yesterday's minutes
        into the session on an IEX entitlement. Two changes follow from that:
        the resolver now falls through to today's minute bar and then today's
        forming session bar (both aggregations of real prints on the same
        entitled venue, neither a quote), and the `session_*` block is
        BLANKED when the snapshot's daily bar is not today's — Alpaca returns
        the previous session's bar in that slot for a name that has not
        printed, and it was being rendered to the analyst as "CURRENT SESSION
        (TODAY)".

        The resolved number is published as `live_price` (with
        `live_price_source` and `live_price_at`), NOT as `last_price`. The
        raw provider field keeps its own name so no reader can pick up an
        unchecked number believing it was checked.
