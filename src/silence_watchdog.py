"""The desk-wide silence watchdog — alerts on the ABSENCE of a session, not
a known failure inside one.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES (docs/WORK.md item 17c)
--------------------------------------------
`src/alert_watchdog.py` proves the Telegram PIPE still works. It says
nothing about whether the desk did any work: it would report the channel
perfectly healthy while the pipeline sat frozen behind a latched circuit,
a database that cannot be opened, or any other total failure — imagined or
not. On 2026-09-02 that happened live: a database fault latched paid
analysis off durably, the alert ABOUT that latch also failed to send, and
nobody was told until a person happened to look.

Every alarm this desk has ever had fires on an EVENT. This is the first one
that fires on the ABSENCE of events, which is exactly the shape that failure
took — a broken alert path cannot defeat an alarm whose trigger is silence
itself.

WHAT COUNTS AS "A SESSION HAPPENED"
------------------------------------
Not `agent_logs`: a crashed or partially-run session can leave rows there
(one LLM call succeeded before the crash), so its presence does not prove
completion.

Instead this reuses `alert_channel_checks` (owned by `src/alert_watchdog.py`)
keyed by `source`. Every one of `main.py`'s scheduled modes writes exactly
one row there from its `finally` block — reached even when the pipeline body
raised, per `main.py`'s own comment: "a watchdog that can replace the
in-flight session exception is worse than no watchdog", so this write is
attempted on every path out of a session, success or failure. It is the
closest thing this codebase has to "a run happened", and it already exists —
reusing it means this module adds no new instrumentation to the trading
path, only a new READER of state that path already produces.

`source == "heartbeat_timer"` (the daily probe in `scripts/alert_heartbeat.py`)
is deliberately excluded: it proves the pipe, not the desk, which is the
exact distinction item 17c exists to preserve. Only the six scheduled
trading modes in `src.trading_calendar.SESSION_WINDOWS` count as evidence of
life here.

DESK-WIDE, NOT PER-MODE
------------------------
The six modes are not independent processes with independent purposes to
monitor separately — they are one desk taking turns through one day. A
single mode legitimately producing nothing that window (e.g. `close` firing
outside a position-holding day) must not read as an outage while `morning`
and `intra_check` are running fine either side of it. So "silence" is
judged across ALL modes together: ANY completed session, in ANY mode, within
a scheduled window counts as evidence the desk is alive for that window.

WHY A PERSISTED "LAST KNOWN ALIVE" MARKER, NOT A FRESH DB SCAN EVERY RUN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The failure this watches for includes "the database cannot be opened" — the
same database this module would otherwise have to re-query in full on every
invocation to reconstruct history. Recomputing from scratch would make the
detector blind exactly when it matters most: an unreadable database would
read as "we cannot prove anything happened, so say nothing" instead of
"we cannot prove anything happened, and that is itself the finding."

So the on-box record (`data/alerting/silence_heartbeat.json`, same pattern
and same reasoning as `scripts/alert_heartbeat.py`'s on-box copy) carries
`last_known_session_at` forward across runs. Each run tries to advance it
from the database; if the database cannot be read, the marker simply does
not advance, and the elapsed-window count computed against it keeps
climbing on wall-clock time alone until either a fresh session is recorded
or the alert fires. The alert itself goes out through `send_owner_alert`,
which never touches this database.

ONE ALERT PER SILENCE EPISODE, NOT PER CHECK
----------------------------------------------
The on-box record also carries `alerted_for_baseline`: the `last_known_
session_at` value that was current when the alert last fired. A repeat run
against the same baseline does not re-alert — the operator already knows.
A NEW session recorded (baseline advances) clears it, so a second, later
silence episode alerts again. This mirrors `alert_heartbeat.py`'s
`consecutive_failures` reset-on-success shape.

THE THRESHOLD IS A PLACEHOLDER, NOT A DECIDED NUMBER
-------------------------------------------------------
`DEFAULT_SILENT_WINDOW_THRESHOLD = 6` — one full scheduled trading day
(`earnings_preprocess`, `morning`, `intra_check`, `midday`, `close`,
`evening` — the six entries in `src.trading_calendar.SESSION_WINDOWS`), the
smallest unit that reads as "unambiguous", chosen because a shorter run of
misses has mundane, non-outage explanations (a single self-gated skip, a
timer landing just outside a window, one delayed tick) while a FULL day of
zero completed sessions across every mode has never happened on a healthy
desk. Per this repo's rule that no agent picks a risk/quality threshold
unilaterally, this number is NOT ratified — see the `DECIDE BY` line this
change adds to `docs/WORK.md`. It is fully parameterised (constructor /
CLI argument) so changing it later is a one-line, no-code-review-needed
edit, not a redesign.
