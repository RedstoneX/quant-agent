"""How much paid-model credit is left, and is that enough for tomorrow?

On 2026-09-29 the single OpenRouter balance ran out and every paid seat was
refused at once. This module is the early warning, read by the dashboard's
/health payload and spoken by every out-of-credit message. It reuses the
desk's own spend record (`llm_budget_days`, written by the cost circuit) and
invents nothing. It makes NO network call of its own.

WHERE THE BALANCE COMES FROM, in order:
  1. `data/openrouter_balance.json` -- the provider's own figure (OpenRouter
     GET /api/v1/credits: total_credits - total_usage), written by
     `src.openrouter_balance.record_openrouter_balance()` from the twice-daily
     pricing-refresh timer. That fetch goes through cost_table, the
     module that already reaches openrouter.ai (replay-seam guard). When the
     provider refuses the call the timer logs the reason at ERROR, no file is
     written, and step 2 applies. Spend recorded after the snapshot day is
     subtracted so the figure keeps falling between refreshes.
  2. DERIVED: the recorded top-up (`llm_cost_circuit.openrouter_topup_usd`
     and `_date`) minus the desk's recorded spend from that date on.
The payload says which one it used (`source`). A snapshot file that exists
but cannot be read is reported as `unknown` naming the file -- it does not
quietly fall through to the derived figure.

THE TRIGGER IS MEASURED, NOT PICKED. One full trading day costs what the
desk's own record says it cost; the worst recorded full day is the yardstick.
The warning fires when the balance is below TWO of those: the balance seen
now must pay for the day in progress AND leave one more full session.
