"""One definition per quantity, for quantities more than one subsystem needs.

Why this module exists
----------------------
Several numbers in this system were computed independently in two or three
places and disagreed with each other — the trading engine sized against one
figure while Mission Control printed another under the same word. Measured
examples that motivated this file:

- "deployable cash": the engine used `cash + parked sweep value`, the API
  used `max(cash - reserve, 0)`. Same name, opposite adjustments, 1.64x
  apart on the same book. The operator was reading a number no part of the
  engine had ever used.
- "% deployed": the risk gate measured signed, leverage-weighted net
  exposure; the dashboard summed long + hedge market value raw and drew the
  result against the ENGINE's ceiling — 46% vs 22% on the same book.
- "20-day average dollar volume": three definitions (fixed /20, /surviving
  bars, and a 21-bar mean), 5.26% apart with a single halted session in the
  window — enough to flip an admission gate.

The rule this module encodes: **a quantity has exactly one definition, and
every caller routes through it.** Thresholds stay with the callers — two
gates legitimately compare the same measure against different numbers.
Duplicating the MEASURE is what drifts.

Structural constraints
----------------------
This module is deliberately dependency-free (stdlib only). It must stay
importable by `src/api/`, which a ratified guardrail
(`tests/test_api_safety.py`) forbids from importing `src.pipeline`,
`src.pipeline_stages` or `src.risk`. Extracting the pure measurement
functions to a module outside `src.risk` is the seam `routes_live.py`'s
§11.2 note already named as the precondition for the dashboard reporting
exposure at all. Nothing here reads config, touches the broker, or makes a
decision — it is arithmetic with an agreed meaning.
