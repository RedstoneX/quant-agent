"""The alert channel's own watchdog — the sessions test the alarm they rely on.

THE DEFECT
----------
Every alarm on this desk is a Telegram message: deploy drift, a pricing
cache that did not land, a session that crashed, a stop that went missing.
Nothing checked that a Telegram message could still be sent, so "no alert
arrived" meant two different things at once —

    nothing is wrong        (the desk is healthy)
    the alarm is broken     (the desk may be on fire)

— and nothing on the box could tell them apart.

TWO FAILURE MODES, DELIBERATELY SEPARATED
-----------------------------------------
They need different answers, and conflating them is what produced the
previous design (a weekly "still alive" message whose absence was supposed
to be the signal — i.e. up to seven days of undetected breakage).

  (A) THE CHANNEL IS BROKEN WHILE THE BOX IS ALIVE. A revoked bot token, a
      chat id that is wrong or deleted, a bot the operator blocked, a new
      egress rule that drops api.telegram.org, a unit that never sourced
      `.env`. Every one of these passes a credentials check and fails a
      send. This is the LIKELY failure, and it is fully detectable from
      inside the box. THIS MODULE COVERS (A).

  (B) THE BOX ITSELF IS DEAD, OFF, OR UNREACHABLE. By definition nothing
      running on the box can report this. No amount of local engineering
      solves it and this module does not pretend to. See README's
      "Proving the alert channel is alive" for what is and is not covered,
      and `scripts/alert_heartbeat.py::ping_healthcheck` for the dormant,
      unconfigured out-of-band hook that would cover it if the owner ever
      wants an external dependency.

THE MECHANISM FOR (A): THE THING THAT DEPENDS ON THE ALARM TESTS IT
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The desk already runs five to six sessions every weekday and every one of
them ends by pushing a Telegram message. So each session now exercises the
whole alert path end to end as part of its own run — `TelegramNotifier.probe`
(one real silent message, deleted immediately afterwards), the same code the
scheduled heartbeat uses. No new schedule, no new credential, no new
dependency, and no LLM call.

The verdict is written to SQLite (`alert_channel_checks`), which is what
makes it durable and readable by Mission Control. A broken channel therefore
shows up in three places that do NOT depend on Telegram working:

  * Mission Control `/health` -> `alert_channel`, rendered red.
  * The session's own status message (forced out even for modes that are
    normally silent) — futile if the channel is fully dead, but a channel
    can fail a probe at a stage an ordinary send survives, and it is how
    the RECOVERY gets reported.
  * The systemd journal / unit state for the heartbeat timer.

WHAT THIS COSTS
---------------
Two extra HTTPS requests to api.telegram.org per session, one row in a
SQLite table, no LLM call, no paid dependency.

NEVER RAISES
------------
Every public function here swallows its own failures. This runs inside
`main.py`'s `finally` block: a raise here would replace the in-flight
session exception and hide the real fault behind a watchdog bug. A watchdog
that can break the thing it watches is worse than no watchdog.
