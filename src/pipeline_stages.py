"""Pipeline stages — explicit, composable, per-responsibility units.

Phase 4 #1 of the architecture work. `TradingPipeline` was a 2600-line
god object whose three `run_*` methods each did data-fetching, LLM
orchestration, risk filtering, order execution, and audit logging
inline. Nothing could be tested in isolation; nothing could be reused
across sessions.

Here we extract the logical phases into stand-alone stages that take a
`RunContext` (explicit shared state), read/write specific fields on it,
and return it (or an early-exit dict) for the next stage.

Morning composes four stages:
  1. MorningResearchStage — parallel macro/news/tech/earnings fan-out
  2. DecisionStage         — L2..L8 memory + PM + Constructor
  3. RiskStage             — hard filter + correlation + RM review + mods
  4. ExecutionStage        — HOLD audit → SELLs → wait fills → BUYs

Midday and evening are *themselves* single-stage workflows (account
snapshot → review/report → log). They have no internal sub-pipeline
to compose, so they stay as TradingPipeline methods rather than being
wrapped in an artificial "stage of one".

Dependency injection pattern: research stage takes each provider/agent
by hand (demonstrates the pure form). Decision/Risk/Execution each take
a `pipeline` reference for the large surface of helpers they share with
TradingPipeline (_build_* memory layers, _filter_* risk helpers,
_order_accepted, _full_sell_qty, etc.). The pragmatic tradeoff: no
tangled re-plumbing of 15+ helpers just to say "zero coupling." Those
helpers are the right extraction boundary for a later phase.

    wrong one mis-sizes the position PROPORTIONALLY. It must therefore be a
    real TODAY PRINT (`LivePrice.is_today_print`), never a quote MID and

    This is deliberately stricter than `_today_order_price`, the FILL
    reference, where a live quote mid IS a legitimate marketable-limit
    reference mid-session (owner 2026-09-12) — bounding an order you are

    It accepts the SAME today prices the constructor sizes off, so the two

    Test compatibility: when the broker is a MagicMock whose

    `get_intraday_snapshots` does not return a usable payload, this falls
    through to the bare `get_latest_price` exactly as `_today_order_price`

    have BEEN that day: this run's own persisted evidence shows
    `TechAnalysisResult.computed_levels` did not exist in the code that ran
    that morning (every one of that day's 59 tech_analyst evidence rows

    whether structure existed. **Do not cite this function as what happened
    2026-09-01.**

    What IS true: the fix for that defect, shipped the same night, made
    `computed_levels` load-bearing. `derive_structural_target`

    a postmortem could read after the fact — only a per-symbol WARNING log
    line for the latter, gone at the next log rotation, and the former not

    fault — `FAULT_NO_STRUCTURE`, `data_fault` row, owner alert — rather
    than a refusal. This run-level check is unchanged and complementary.)

    `analyses` is scoped to RESOLVED symbols only (never-resolved symbols —
    an LLM parse failure — are `data_status["tech"]` partial/failed and the
    `analysis_parse_loss` advisory's job already; mixing that failure mode
    into a levels-coverage number would double-count it under a misleading
    label). The two share thresholds below are module constants —
    `LEVELS_BLIND_RUN_EMPTY_SHARE` / `LEVELS_DEGRADED_RUN_EMPTY_SHARE` — see
