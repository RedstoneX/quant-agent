    (or was never touched again) before a retry succeeded, the failure was
    both terminal and invisible: no record survived to let a later run
    retry it or to let anything else notice. This writes the outcome into
    the SAME durable JSON marker `mark_unavailable` already writes for the
    latch itself (the one filesystem fact guaranteed to exist and to be
    independent of whatever database fault caused the latch in the first
    place), under the shared `_file_lock`, so:
      * a later process re-reading this file (`_read_alert_outcome`) knows
        immediately whether the operator was ever actually told, and keeps

        `UnavailableLLMCostCircuit._state()` / `status()` -- a visible
        surface (Mission Control / session summaries already read
        `status()`) that keeps climbing for as long as delivery keeps
        failing, rather than the failure being silently dropped after one
        in-memory attempt.

    Never raises and never invents a marker: if the latch file does not
    exist yet (e.g. this is running against a ":memory:" breaker with no
    filesystem sidecar), this is a no-op -- there is nothing durable to
    update, matching how `mark_unavailable` itself degrades for that case.
