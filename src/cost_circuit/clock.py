    exactly as it always has -- the same OS clock, the same instant.

    WHY IT EXISTS. The circuit dates two different ways: the ET day comes
    from Python here, and `suspended_at` / `created_at` come from SQLite's
    `'now'`. In production those are the same clock and cannot disagree. In
    a test they can, because a test freezes the Python side and cannot
    freeze SQLite's -- and a few minutes after ET midnight the two land on
    different ET days, which is what reds this module's self-clear tests
