"""Persistent, cross-process circuit breaker for paid LLM analysis.

The breaker is deliberately independent from the trading decision path.  It
can suspend model requests, but it cannot stop broker reconciliation,
broker-resident protective orders, deterministic loss checks, P&L capture,
or the read-only API.

Every provider request is authorized in SQLite under ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE``.
That matters because the morning and intraday systemd jobs are separate
processes and can otherwise both observe the same remaining budget and spend
it.

=== docs/WORK.md item 14 (OWNER-APPROVED 2026-08-31, replaced 2026-09-02) ===

This module used to reserve a conservative, worst-case dollar estimate for
every call BEFORE it was made, and replace that estimate with the real cost
once the provider responded. That was deleted. Real calls settle at a
median 0.38x of the pinned worst-case rate, so the reservation held ~2.6x
what was ever really spent and stopped the desk on money that was never
spent -- three times in one hour on 2026-09-02, against ~$1/day of actual
spend on a $2.75 ceiling. The guard was causing more outages than it
prevented losses.

The replacement is exactly three things, per the owner's decision, and
nothing else:

  (a) A spend cap on the OpenRouter API key itself, OUTSIDE this codebase,
      so no bug here can defeat it. NOT IMPLEMENTED HERE -- it is not code.
      See docs/WORK.md item 14(a) for the exact provider-side limit to
      configure; do not let this fall through the cracks just because it
      has no corresponding diff.
  (b) Stop when REAL SETTLED cost actually spent today (or this session)
      hits its cap. No pre-call estimate, so nothing to be wrong about --
      `complete_call`/`fail_call` record the provider's ACTUAL returned
      cost, and `_enforce_settled_limits_locked` checks that recorded total
      against the cap, both before a call starts and immediately after one
      settles.
  (c) Stop when one session exceeds `max_calls_per_session` calls -- a
      count-based runaway-loop guard, independent of price, because a
      loop is defined by call COUNT and counting cannot be wrong about a
      rate. See `begin_call`.

The maximum overshoot of (b) is one call's real cost -- under a dollar,
measured. That is worth it against a desk switched off for a day.

# --- Patch mirroring. Every definition moved verbatim into one of the
# submodules, each of which holds its own binding of the shared names it
# imports (`_now_utc`, `_et_day_and_utc_bounds`, ...). Tests patch those
# names on `src.cost_circuit` and expect the moved code to see the patched
# object, so an assignment here is written through to every submodule that
# already holds the name. Undo (mock.patch / monkeypatch setting the
# original back) travels the same path. This is the ONE mirror block for
# this package; do not add a second one -- two cancel each other out.
