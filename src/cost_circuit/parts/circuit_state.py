        """Expire a hard latch raised by a transient provider failure.

        Defect B (2026-09-22). A latch of the `_SELF_CLEARING_HARD_TRIGGERS`
        class -- a provider call that FAILED with an unprovable cost -- used
        to sit until a human noticed. It never once sat because money had
        actually run out: all four such latches on the production DB were
        cleared by an operator with spend well under cap [measured]. On
        2026-09-22 that cost the close run, the evening run and nine hours
        of refused analysis on 29% of the daily budget.

        WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It never moves a dollar and
        never touches a cap: settled spend on the day and the session rows
        is left exactly as recorded, `self.config`'s limits are only read,
        and `_enforce_settled_limits_locked` -- which runs at every
        authorization boundary, including immediately after this on the same
        connection -- re-latches instantly if real spend is over the line.
        The only thing cleared is the "we could not prove this figure" flag
        on rows this circuit itself booked as failed calls.

        Every one of these must hold, or nothing happens:

        1. The circuit is suspended on a hard trigger in
           `_SELF_CLEARING_HARD_TRIGGERS`. Any other code -- an integrity
           fault, a completed call with unknown cost, anything unrecognized
           -- keeps the durable operator-reset latch, unchanged.
        2. No durable emergency file latch exists. That path means the
           circuit's own infrastructure failed, so nothing it computes may
           be trusted to authorize its own recovery; it stays operator-only.
        3. Every unknown row is a failed-call row, checked on EVERY day the
           latch spans -- the ET day it was stamped on and today. A latch
           can outlive midnight (the 2026-09-22 one did, 15:17 UTC to 00:33
           UTC), and today's row is freshly seeded with zero unknown rows,
           so checking only today would wave through a latch whose actual
           unproven rows sit on yesterday. One row of any other provenance,
           on either day, and it waits for a human. A `failed_call` counter
           ABOVE the total it is a subset of is corruption, and also
           refuses -- deliberately as a refusal to self-clear rather than
           as an accounting invariant, so a bug in this counter falls back
           to the operator instead of escalating to the emergency latch.
        4. `transient_latch_cooldown_minutes` of wall clock has elapsed
           since `suspended_at`, measured by SQLite against the same clock
           that wrote it. A negative elapsed time (clock regression) does
           not qualify.
        5. The day's auto-clear allowance is not spent. A fault recurring
           past that is not transient, and the next occurrence latches
           durably -- which is also what bounds how many unproven-cost calls
           one day can forgive without a human.
        6. Settled day and session spend are both strictly under their caps
           already. This never reopens into a breach.

        Returns True when the latch was cleared.
