        """Operator-only manual reset. A reason is mandatory and audited.

        Also clears an INEXACT current ET day, which is the other fault only
        an operator can resolve. `fail_call` stamps `costs_exact=0` when it
        charges a conservative reserve for a request whose true cost it could
        not learn, and nothing sets it back within the day -- the flag clears
        only when the next ET day seeds a fresh row. Meanwhile
        `_reconcile_quota_holds_locked` REFUSES to rearm over an inexact day,
        by design.

        Until 2026-08-31 those two facts never met, because an inexact day
        was always accompanied by a hard latch, and the reconciler returns
        early whenever one is set -- the latch was, in effect, masking the
        refusal. Scoping `provider_attempt_limit` to the session removed that
        latch and exposed the real shape of it: an inexact day with no latch
        made every subsequent `activate_session` raise, with no operator
        action able to clear it, until ET rollover. A crash loop is a worse
        failure than the suspension it replaced.

        What this does NOT do is erase settled spend. The day's recorded
        amount is left exactly as it stands -- including the conservative
        reserve charged for the unresolved request, which over-states cost
        rather than under-stating it. Only the "we could not prove this
        figure" flag is cleared, and only by a named operator giving a
        reason. Recomputing what the provider really charged is not
        something this code can honestly do.

        Deciding that a conservative figure is good enough to continue on
        was, until 2026-09-23, described here as "precisely an operator's
        call" full stop. That is now true with one bounded exception, and
        the sentence is amended rather than left to disagree with the code:
        `_auto_clear_transient_latch_locked` makes the same decision without
        a human for rows this circuit itself booked as FAILED calls, and
        only those, under the guards listed on that method -- a cooldown, a
        finite daily allowance, spend under both caps, and every unknown row
        on every day the latch spans being one of that kind. Real unmeasured
        spend from a call that SUCCEEDED, an integrity fault, and the
        durable infrastructure latch are all still this method's alone. The
        argument for the exception is in `docs/INCIDENT_HISTORY.md` under
        2026-09-22: four operator resets of that one class on the live
        circuit, not one of them following a budget breach.
