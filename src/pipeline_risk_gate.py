"""RiskGate — the deterministic application of risk verdicts to sizes. MONEY.

Conversion step 7 (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §4). The hard-block filter that drops
a decision the risk engine refused, the durable record of that block, the
application of the risk seat's size/stop/target modifications, the minimum-
risk floor breach, the reconciliation of a modified size back to the risk
budget, the research pre-filter, and the refusal of a queued BUY whose filing
is unread. Every body here is the former `RiskGateMixin` body, byte for byte;
only the collaborators changed from inherited attributes to constructor
parameters. `TradingPipeline` reaches it through the thin delegating
`RiskGateMixin` in `src/pipeline_risk_gate_mixin.py`.

`compute_indicators` and `_get_sector` resolve against THIS module (patch
them here). Nothing here may import `src.pipeline` (boundary clause 3).

        """Apply RM-proposed field modifications to decisions.

        When a mod fails Pydantic validation, the decision is **dropped** rather
        than left at its original (un-tightened) value. RM's job is to be more
        protective; if their proposed change can't be applied, we cannot assume
        the un-modified decision is safe — the safest invariant is "RM tried to
        change this, we couldn't, so don't execute it". Previously a break left
        the original decision in place, silently dropping RM's protective intent.

        Two further guards (2026-09-03 audit), both because a field-valid
        `TradeDecision` is not the same thing as a MORE PROTECTIVE one, and
        this function's whole job is the latter:

        1. **An exit can never be silently cancelled by an edit.** A SELL or
           COVER's `allocation_pct` reaching 0 through an RM modification
           reads as "skip" at execution (see `pipeline_stages.py`'s
           `RiskStage.run`, "CLAUDE.md convention: allocation_pct=0 means
           SKIP") — a real exit vanishes with no distinguishable trace.
           Observed live 2026-08-24 on two symbols. If the RM genuinely
           believes an exit should not happen, it already has a real
           mechanism for that — `RiskVerdict.rejected_symbols`
           (`SymbolRejection`, handled in `RiskStage.run` before this method
           ever runs) — a REFUSAL, distinguishable from an edit. A
           modification is not that mechanism, so this method refuses the
           EDIT (keeps the exit at its pre-modification size) rather than
           refusing the trade itself: reverting is the closer match to "RM
           tried to protect this and couldn't", the same invariant already
           governing the validation-failure branch below, and it does not
           require inventing a new rejection channel for something the
           schema already has one for.
        1b. **An entry's `allocation_pct` may only be reduced — BUY and
           SHORT alike.** This seat exists to be MORE protective than the
           constructor, and nothing enforced that:
           `RiskModification.new_value` is unbounded. On an entry that adds
           to a held name the field is an INCREMENT on top of the existing
           weight, so an upward edit grows the position by more than the
           number reads (2026-09-18: an edit believed to cut a name to 30%
           left it at 50.8%). An increase is reverted and recorded in
           `rejected_mods` — same posture as guard 1, the trade still ships at
           the constructor's size. Checked AFTER schema validation, unlike
           guard 1: an out-of-range value (allocation_pct > 100) must keep
           hitting the validation branch below and DROP the decision, which is
           stricter still. This guard governs only the values Pydantic accepts.
        2. **A stop/target edit cannot bypass the checks a fresh decision
           would have to clear.** The constructor measures reward:risk on a
           range setup (refusing only an UNMEASURABLE ratio — a computed
           ratio is a ranking input, not a gate, and a breakout
           is never measured) and enforces a noise-band stop distance before
           a decision ever reaches the Risk Manager; both checks compared a
           modified decision only against itself, so an RM edit that widened
           a stop or pulled in a target could ship a BUY/SHORT whose
           reward:risk the constructor could not have measured, or a stop
           resting inside the ATR noise band. Invented numeric reward:risk
           floors are retired. This reuses the SAME arithmetic (`TradeDecision.reward_risk`,
           which is `models.reward_to_risk` — the one ratio definition every
           other gate in this codebase already shares) and the SAME
           configured floor (`RiskConfig.absolute_min_stop_atr_multiple`) the
           constructor uses, rather than re-deriving either. The noise-band
           half only runs when `symbols_bars` is supplied and yields a usable
           ATR reading; when it can't be computed the edit is refused rather
           than guessed at ("reject outright if it can't be safely
           re-verified" — the same posture as the noise-band check itself,
           which does not invent a stop distance it cannot measure).

        Returns `(decisions, rejected_mods)`. `rejected_mods` records every
        modification this method refused to apply — as opposed to a decision
        DROPPED outright by a validation failure — so the caller can persist
        a visible pipeline event for each one instead of the edit just
        disappearing.

        `unapplied` (board item 164, 2026-09-19) is an optional sink for the
        three outcomes `rejected_mods` deliberately does NOT carry, each of
        which used to reach the log only: a decision DROPPED because the
        edit failed schema validation (`outcome="dropped"`), an edit naming
        a field this method cannot modify, and an edit naming a symbol with
        no decision in the plan (both `outcome="modification_not_applied"`).
        Each entry names the symbol, the gate, the value asked for and the
        seat's own reason. Recording only — nothing here changes what is
        applied, reverted or dropped.

        """The `allocation_pct` that keeps `modified`'s dollar risk at or below
        the dollar risk the pre-edit `original` ticket carried, or None when it
        cannot be measured.

        Board item 134. The constructor sizes a position so the number of
        shares put its stop distance's worth of loss at exactly the granted
        risk budget: `shares = equity*risk_pct / |entry - stop|`, and
        downstream execution spends the resulting `allocation_pct` as
        `qty = equity * allocation_pct/100 / entry`. Substituting, the fraction
        of equity a ticket risks is

            dollar_risk / equity = allocation_pct/100 * |entry - stop| / entry

        — it depends only on the ticket's own fields, not on the book value.
        So the pre-edit ticket's own risk fraction is the budget to preserve
        (it is already the constructor's granted risk after every single-name,
        portfolio and sector clamp, so it never over-states what was granted).
        Solving that identity for the allocation that reproduces the SAME
        fraction under the edited entry/stop gives the reconciled size:

            reconciled = original_alloc * (|e0 - s0|/e0) / (|e1 - s1|/e1)

        The short-side gap-risk haircut the constructor applies to
        risk-per-share cancels in this ratio, so shorts need no special case.
        Returns the reconciled allocation only; the caller takes the smaller of
        it and the current allocation so a tighter stop can never auto-enlarge
        the position. None when either ticket is geometrically degenerate
        (non-finite or non-positive entry, or a zero pre/post risk-per-share),
        in which case the caller leaves the size untouched.

        Precision of the preserved budget:

        - For a STOP edit the reconciliation is EXACT: the entry is unchanged,
          so `allocation_pct` and stop distance are the only moving parts and
          the identity holds against whatever entry execution ultimately sizes
          off.
        - For an ENTRY edit it is exact ONLY when execution's sizing
          denominator equals the edited entry. Execution actually sizes off
          `sizing_price = max(today_print, entry)` for a long / `min(...)` for
          a short (`_place_buy_with_sizing` in `pipeline_stages.py`), so under
          market drift the denominator differs and the preserved budget is
          APPROXIMATE. It is bounded on the high side by the execution-time 5%
          `_qty_by_risk_budget` ceiling and this reconciliation only ever
          REDUCES the allocation, so the approximation can under-risk but never
          over-risk.

        Scope: this guarantee covers the RM EDIT only. An execution-time ATR
        stop-widen applied AFTER this stage is reconciled solely against that
        same 5% `_qty_by_risk_budget` ceiling (pre-existing behaviour, not
        introduced here) — this method does not and cannot re-run for it.
