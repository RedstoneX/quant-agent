        """Cash QAMC can deploy into equities WITHOUT borrowing.

        Verified Alpaca account-field semantics (2026-08-19, official docs):

        - `cash` is credited as soon as a SELL **fills** — Alpaca:
          "The cash is updated post the SELL trade is filled, but the
          cash_withdrawable and cash_transferable are updated post T+1."
          So proceeds of a filled SGOV sale ARE usable for an equity BUY
          the same session; there is no settlement wait for trading.
        - `non_marginable_buying_power` is the settled/non-margin (crypto)
          figure and LAGS a same-day equity sale by one business day. Using
          it to size equity BUYs is wrong in the conservative direction —
          it makes legitimately-available money invisible. An earlier pass
          in this tranche did exactly that; this is the correction.
        - `buying_power` / `regt_buying_power` are MARGIN figures. Every
          Alpaca account is a margin account and this one's equity puts it
          at multiplier 2, so those fields are ~2x equity. QAMC must never
          size against them — that is borrowed money by definition.

        Deployable is therefore raw `cash` plus the market value of the
        cash-equivalent sweep vehicle. Both components are assets QAMC
        already owns, so the sum can never exceed equity and never creates
        leverage. NOTE (item 190): nothing sells the vehicle before the BUY
        phase any more, so the parked component is owned but not
        automatically converted; see docs/WORK.md item 190.

        This is a PLANNING figure for PM / RM / the pre-trade gate. It is
        not authoritative for execution, and — stale since the 2026-09-02
        margin flip — it is no longer true that execution "skips any BUY
        that cash does not actually cover": ExecutionStage still re-reads
        raw broker `cash` after the funding sale, but with `allow_margin`
        true a BUY may draw beyond that raw cash, bounded by the §11.2
        gross-exposure ladder's headroom, not by this figure (see
        `_entry_deployment_budget` in `src/pipeline_stages.py`). With
        `allow_margin` false the old description still holds: cash is the
        hard ceiling. Either way, this function itself never reads
        `buying_power` / `regt_buying_power` — see above — that boundary is
        unrelated to and unmoved by the ladder.

        The arithmetic itself lives in `src.quantities.deployable_cash` —
        one definition, shared with Mission Control's "Deployable" tile,
        which used to show `max(cash - sweep_reserve, 0)` instead and read
        1.58x lower than the figure the engine actually sized against.

        **Why "since reset" and not "since inception".** The desk's
        2026-09-02 book-wide liquidation archived every prior trade/
        daily_pnl row (see docs/INCIDENT_HISTORY.md); the live `daily_pnl`
        table has held no row earlier than that date since. A "total"
        spanning that boundary would silently splice pre-reset and

        were continuous — exactly the defect he flagged. So the baseline
        is the EARLIEST row this table actually has, never reconstructed
        from the archive.

        **Why that row's `total_value - daily_pnl`, not its `equity_close`.**
        `equity_close` is that day's OWN 4pm close — already one day inside
        the post-reset period, which would drop that first day's P&L from
        the total. `total_value - daily_pnl` recovers the broker's

        is built from everywhere else in this file), i.e. the account's
        equity immediately before the first post-reset trading day —

        The distinction it rests on is categorical and needs no threshold: a
        seat that had nothing to report answered; a seat whose answer was
        lost did not. See `src/evidence_gate.py` for why no count is used and
        why the counting half of the owner's design is deliberately unbuilt.

        WHICH LOST SEAT ACTUALLY STOPS THE RUN is an owner mandate decision
        of 2026-09-18 — "Only technical analysis can stop the desk" — and
        lives in `evidence_gate.BLOCKING_SEATS`, not here. A lost ADVISORY
        seat is recorded in the same durable rows, logged loudly, carried in
        the result so the unsuppressible data-quality alert still fires, and
        named in the freshness disclosure. It does not halt trading.

        EVERY DECISION DISCLOSES ITS OWN EVIDENCE FRESHNESS. With the other
        seats advisory a decision can rest on one freshly-read seat plus a
        carried-forward book, and every carried seat reports green; this is
        the one path every decision passes through, so the count of seats
        read on THIS tick is computed here and handed to the owner's message
        and the durable record. Disclosure, not a threshold — there is no
        minimum fresh count anywhere and none may be invented.

        THE SKIP IS LOUD, by three independent paths, because retired item 11
        was this desk producing nothing for a whole day with nobody noticing
        (docs/INCIDENT_HISTORY.md, closed 2026-09-13):
          - its own standalone owner alert, sent here — MORNING ONLY as of
            2026-09-18. On an intra_check tick the session message below is
            guaranteed to speak (`evidence_gate_skip` is actionable on the
            trader feed and is in none of its silent-status sets), so this
            alert only duplicated it, one minute apart, word for word;
          - `notifier.maybe_alert_data_quality`, which fires from main.py's
            finally block on the `data_status` carried in the result and
            cannot be suppressed by a mode's noise policy;
          - the session result message, whose `status` says it in one word.

        It drops no candidate and emits no target: it returns before any
        target exists, so it cannot produce the 0%-target-means-SELL shape.
        Every symbol that HAD reached a technical read still gets its own
        durable, machine-readable row saying why the desk never decided on
        it, alongside the run-level row.
