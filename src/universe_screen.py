"""Universe expansion and pruning — THE admission screen.

Built 2026-09-19 from the design agreed with the owner on 2026-09-01
(docs/INCIDENT_HISTORY.md, "Universe expansion and pruning — DESIGN AGREED
WITH THE OWNER 2026-09-01"). Owner, restating it 2026-09-19: add stocks that
pass standard desk filters — "a certain amount of liquidity, a certain
minimum price ... filter out the garbage, the penny stocks, the highly
speculative" — and remove the ones that stop passing.

ONE SCREEN. Every path that can put a symbol outside the hand-typed
`trading.universe` in front of the desk calls `screen_symbol` (or its batch
form in `run_screen`): the weekly broker-asset-list screen, the SEC Form 4
smart-money side door and the Phase 9 nomination side door. Behind
`universe_screen.enabled`, default OFF; with it off every caller keeps its
pre-existing behaviour.

THE CRITERIA, and where each threshold comes from (every number is in
`config/number_ledger.yaml`; nothing below is chosen here):

  asset       broker says the symbol exists, is `active`, `tradable`, a US
              equity on a listed exchange, and is not a warrant, unit,
              right, preferred or depositary receipt. Delisted /
              inactive / untradable is PERMANENT: an admitted name is
              removed at once, no second chance.
  history     a year of daily bars: the first bar is at least a calendar
              year before the last, AND there are enough bars for the
              200-session average plus the 10-session slope the analyst
              reads (`technical.LONGEST_INDICATOR_WINDOW` +
              `context._SLOPE_LOOKBACK`).
  price       last close >= `min_price_usd` ($5, SEC Rule 3a51-1(d): a
              security priced at five dollars or more is not a penny stock).
  spread      the Corwin & Schultz (J. Finance 2012) high-low spread
              estimate over that year of bars. Half of it — the cost of
              crossing from mid to the far side — must not exceed the
              desk's own entry-slippage belt (`execution.
              max_entry_slippage_bps`): a name whose ordinary half-spread
              is already past the belt is one the execution stage would
              refuse to cross. Replaces the $10M dollar-volume floor, as the
              design required. Estimated from bars, not quotes, because
              this account sees IEX quotes only and those are routinely
              absurd (src/pipeline_stages.py, the CCJ 15%-spread note).
  volatility  ATR(14) / price < 1 / the widest stop multiple the desk's
              own rules can reach (`portfolio_constructor.
              widest_reachable_stop_atr_multiple`, 1/3.00 = 33.3% at
              today's ratified settings). At or past it the widest
              legitimate stop — that multiple of ATR under price — sits at
              or below ZERO, so no stop this desk would place can be
              placed at all and the name fails by construction. Nothing is
              chosen here: the bound is arithmetic, and it moves by itself
              if the stop multiple or its setup/regime scalers move.
  size        market capitalisation >= `min_market_cap_usd` ($30M, the
              Russell US indexes' eligibility floor).
  sector      resolves to a real sector — the sector cap needs one. Kept
              from the pre-existing side-door gate.
  takeover    no pending acquisition: the issuer's SEC filing history
              holds no merger proxy / tender-offer filing that a later
              8-K Item 1.02 (termination of a material definitive
              agreement) has not followed.
  fund        an exchange-traded fund (Yahoo `quoteType == "ETF"`; owner
              ruling 2026-10-09: expand the universe including ETFs) is
              admitted ONLY as an unlevered equity fund. Refused: a
              leveraged or inverse fund (SEC Rule 18f-4(a), 17 CFR
              270.18f-4(a)) -- the order layer's leverage table counts an
              unlisted fund as 1x, so the screen is where one must stop;
              a bond, money-market, ultrashort, treasury or other
              non-equity category -- the owner's mandate forbids parking
              cash in bonds or T-bills (SGOV files as "Ultrashort Bond");
              and a fund with no category at all (fail closed). The
              fund's category string is its sector key. Company size and
              takeover do not apply to a fund and are recorded as "not
              applicable: fund"; liquidity is the same spread check every
              stock passes. Any other fund (Yahoo quote type not EQUITY or
              ETF, or a fund-named security Yahoo calls EQUITY) is refused
              as not a common share, as before.

Short borrow is NOT an admission criterion (owner ruling 2026-10-09): a
name the desk can only buy is still an opportunity. Whether a short can be
borrowed is checked at the order seam, where a short is placed.

NOT criteria, on the owner's ruling: no earnings-date requirement, no
maximum price.

A screen that could not READ something (a data outage) is INCONCLUSIVE: it
admits nothing and counts neither for nor against an admitted name.
