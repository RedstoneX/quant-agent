"""Stop paying to hunt for new trades when the book has no room for one.

Owner ask, 2026-09-30: the desk runs several sessions a day looking for new
trades; when the portfolio is already full that hunting is largely wasted
paid model and paid search spend. It must still be "a balancing act" —
every holding must keep justifying its place on the NORMAL cadence.

So this module throttles the SEARCH, never the REVIEW:

* When the book is full, the research fan-out is narrowed to the names the
  desk already holds (plus this run's free, deterministic admissions —
  see below). Every holding still gets its full five-seat read on every
  normal session, because doctrine requires all five seats to be right to
  STAY, not only to enter.
* The midday / close position-review sessions and the intraday check are
  untouched by this module. They do not hunt.

"Full" is NOT a picked number. It is read off the desk's own ratified
ceilings, so the throttle turns itself off the moment the book stops being
full — no schedule, no cadence dial, nothing to tune:

* `deployable_cash <= 0`   — nothing to buy with without borrowing.
* `deployed_pct >= risk.max_total_position_pct` — the invested ceiling.
* `gross_pct >= risk.max_gross_exposure_x * 100` — the §11.2 gross ceiling.

THE URGENCY LANE. A throttled session is not a blind session:

1. Every deterministic safety step — stop-coverage audit, protection
   restores, forced de-lever, gross-ceiling enforcement, fill and stop-out
   reconciliation — runs BEFORE the paid boundary and is not touched here.
2. Held names keep their full research, so a holding whose thesis has
   broken is still found, voiced and sold on the normal cadence.
3. Run-scoped admissions (`ctx.admitted_symbols`: SEC Form 4 smart-money
   and the universe screen) survive the narrowing. Those come from free,
   deterministic signals, so a genuinely urgent NEW name still reaches the
   seats even while the hunt is throttled.
4. The moment anything frees capital — a stop-out, a de-lever, a sale from
   the review — the ceilings above stop being breached and the very next
   session hunts normally again.

Fails OPEN: any uncertainty here returns "not full" and the full hunt runs.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Board item 177: do not ask the technical seat again when nothing it reads
# has moved.
#
# MEASURED 2026-10-01 against the production DB, read-only: of 723 stock-days
# the technical seat read more than once, 457 (63%) ended the day with the
# same rating AND the same conviction it opened with — 1,056 paid re-reads
# that returned an answer the desk already held. The other 266 stock-days DID
# change verdict intraday, which is exactly how a position that turns bad gets
# caught, so re-reading is not pointless and must not be rationed.
#
# Hence: NO timer, NO counter, NO cooldown, NO sampling rate. The only thing
# that may license skipping a read is the INPUTS not having moved.
#
# WHAT THE VERDICT IS A FUNCTION OF. The seat is a model call; its answer is a
# function of the user message and nothing else. `TechAnalystAgent.
# build_user_message` builds that message out of exactly six things, per
# symbol: the bar series and indicators (`symbols_data`), the prior-rating
# context line (`prior_ratings`), the valuation line (`valuations`), the
# live/forming-session block (`intraday_context`), and the two run-level macro
# strings. Those six ARE the input set, and this fingerprint covers all six.
#
# INPUTS vs OUTPUTS on the evidence row, settled by reading where each field
# is assigned in `_analyze_chunk`:
#   * OUTPUTS (the model emits them; they are the verdict or part of it):
#     rating, conviction, entry_price, reference_target, stop_loss,
#     support_levels, resistance_levels, setup_type, reasoning*, risk_reward.
#     `entry_price` on the row is the seat's PROPOSED entry, not an input —
#     the entry that IS an input is the prior position's, and it reaches the
#     seat through `prior_ratings`, which is fingerprinted.
#   * INPUT-DERIVED (set in Python from the bars, never asked of the model):
#     computed_levels, computed_level_touches, computed_level_bars,
#     levels_coverage, signal_bar_low, signal_bar_high, bars_available,
#     atr_14. These are deterministic functions of the bars, so the bars
#     themselves are fingerprinted instead and these come along for free.
# Only inputs key this cache.
#
# WHY NOT key on those recorded input-derived fields alone: replayed against
# the retained record (2026-10-01), a key built only from them matches on
# 1,652 re-reads — and 269 of those re-reads had a CHANGED verdict. They are
# all bar-derived, the bars do not move intraday, and so they cannot see the
# one input that does: the live price. A cache keyed on them would blind the
# desk to precisely the changes it exists to catch. The fingerprint below
# therefore covers the live/forming-session block too.
#
# FAILS OPEN, everywhere: anything unreadable, unrecognised, missing or
# ambiguous returns None, and a None fingerprint can never match anything, so
# the seat is asked. An extra call costs pennies; a stale verdict is a
# position that should have been sold.
#
# NO TOLERANCE, anywhere: floats are compared by their exact repr, which
# round-trips, so two prices are "the same" only when they are bit-identical.
# No rounding, no band, no "close enough".
