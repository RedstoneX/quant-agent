        """Read EVERY held position's own chart and raise a sale on the ones
        the chart says are finished — whether or not any model mentioned them.

        THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. `check_alignment_exit` shipped wired only as
        a CONFIRMER: it ran solely on positions the review had already named,
        and only GATED the ones whose prose already claimed the alignment
        exit. Nothing ever asked the question of a position the models were
        silent about, so the owner-ratified "sell when the chart says the
        trend is over" rule could never START a sale, and the desk still had
        no sanctioned way to bank a gain on its own.

        HOW IT REACHES THE SELL PATH. It does not open one. A cleared verdict
        becomes an ordinary action item in `best_by_symbol` — the same dict
        the review's own actions land in, resolved by the same
        SELL/COVER > REDUCE > TRAIL_STOP > HOLD priority — so it is then
        subject, unchanged and in order, to every protection an LLM-proposed
        exit gets: the same-day-trim discipline, the spent-trigger layer, the
        named-trigger phrase gate, the exit guard's metric-contradiction
        veto, the AI Risk seat's veto, the qty-sign gate, and the alignment
        verdict itself re-read as the confirmer. A sale this scan raises can
        be refused by any one of them.

        ONE PROTECTION IS DELIBERATELY BYPASSED, and only one: the
        entry-anchored noise band, which asks how far price has travelled
        from WHAT THE DESK PAID. Under the owner's 2026-09-30 ruling the
        alignment exit sells because the move ended on the chart, and what
        the desk paid says nothing about that, so a chart-verified
        alignment sale is not judged against it. Every other layer applies
        unchanged. (Chosen over keeping the band for scan-raised sales
        because a band anchored to the entry would silently veto exactly
        the exits the ruling exists to allow — the ones taken at a gain.)

        WHEN A REFUSAL HAPPENS, THE DISPLACED ACTION COMES BACK. Raising a
        sale overwrites whatever the review proposed for that symbol; if
        that was a TRAIL_STOP and the sale is then refused downstream, the
        position would end the session neither sold nor re-protected —
        strictly worse than the state the scan found. The displaced item is
        therefore kept in `displaced` and re-queued by the executor when a
        scan-raised sale produces no order.

        A model action of EQUAL OR HIGHER priority always wins: the scan
        never overwrites a SELL, COVER or REDUCE the review asked for, and
        never rewrites its reason. It supersedes only HOLD and TRAIL_STOP,
        because under the owner's ruling the END OF A MOVE is decided by
        reading the chart rather than by whether a model mentioned it — and
        a stop adjustment on a position being closed is moot. The prose is
        not irrelevant: when a thesis names an average the desk computes,
        that average is the first mark. It is no longer REQUIRED — a thesis
        naming none falls back to the chart's own averages, so coverage no
        longer depends on model wording.

        A POSITION OPENED IN TODAY'S SESSION IS NOT ELIGIBLE. Nothing in the
        entry path requires a candidate to be above any average, so a name
        can be bought while already below one, and without this the scan
        could close it the same session on a chart the entry seats had
        already read. Date equality only, on the recorded buy.

        FAIL CLOSED. Only `status == "EXIT"` raises a sale. Missing bars, a
        missing ATR, an unresolvable chart mark and every other degraded
        state come back HOLD or UNPARSEABLE and raise nothing, exactly as
        today. Per-symbol failures are swallowed so one unreadable name
        cannot suppress the others — swallowing means NOT selling.

        No new number, no new threshold and no extra agreement requirement:
        what counts as the end of a move is entirely
        `check_alignment_exit`'s decision, read as given.
