        position, including the cross-day confirmation lookup and the
        persist of today's read for the NEXT trading day to confirm
        against. Returns the `StructuralProtectionCheck`.

        `persist=False` makes the call READ-ONLY: the cross-day lookup
        still runs, but today's `raw_broken` is not filed, so this read can
        never become the prior-day half of a future confirmation. Callers
        that are consulting the check purely for the audit trail must pass
        it. Filing a break from a NEW call site would let a break confirm a
        day earlier than it does today, which lifts `protected` a day
        earlier, which can turn a currently-BLOCKED holding-discipline exit
        into an allowed one on the following session — a loosening, by
        side-effect, of a gate this repo deliberately keeps tight
        (docs/WORK.md item 60).

        Spec item 25 (2026-09-03/04, corrected same day) — replaces the
        flat `days_held < 5` holding-discipline window with a data-driven
        one: `src.risk.exit_guard.check_structural_protection`. That
        function is pure; this method supplies it with real numbers
        recomputed straight from bars using the SAME deterministic, no-LLM
        machinery `TechAnalystAgent.analyze_batch` uses when a position is
        first bought (`compute_indicators` for ATR/MAs,
        `find_structural_levels` for the structural levels) — just run
        again here against a HELD position instead of a BUY candidate, on
        the same `config.trading.lookback_days` window so level detection
        sees exactly the bar count it was tuned against.

        DELIBERATELY uses the latest COMPLETED DAILY CLOSE from those same
        bars (`bars[-1].close`), never a live broker/quote price — real
        technical-analysis practice (and `check_structural_protection`'s
        own confirmation gate) requires a level to break on a CLOSE, not an
        intraday tick, or a routine intrabar wick would misread as an
        invalidated thesis.

        The cross-day lookup is keyed off THIS READ's own `bar_date` (the
        actual latest completed close, which may be a prior calendar day if
        the market is still open) rather than wall-clock "today" — several
        same-session pipeline cycles reading the SAME close must never be
        miscounted as two separate confirming trading days.

        Never raises: a bars/indicator failure degrades to no ATR/levels/
        close, which `check_structural_protection` already treats as "no
        qualifying basis" and falls back to its noise-band check on — never
        to a wrong verdict. The DB read/write around it are each wrapped
        separately so a memory hiccup degrades to "unconfirmed" /
        "unpersisted" rather than losing the whole check.
