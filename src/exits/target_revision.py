        THE WAY IN IS THE OPEN BOOK, NOT A FLAG (item 194, 2026-10-01).
        Every held position is adjudicated on every run. A seat raising
        `src.models.TargetRevisionFlag` no longer decides WHETHER a symbol
        is measured, only the seat label and prose evidence recorded
        against it; a flag for a symbol the broker does not show as held is
        still filed as its own finding. Widening the way in added no
        number: the flag carries symbol and evidence and no price, so it
        never fed the arithmetic, and the derivation itself is unchanged.

        A seat raises `src.models.TargetRevisionFlag` — SYMBOL AND EVIDENCE,
        no price; the schema has no price field. This method supplies
        `src.risk.target_revision.assess_target_revision` with real numbers
        recomputed straight from bars, using the same deterministic, no-LLM
        machinery `_structural_protection_for_holding` uses
        (`compute_indicators` for ATR, `find_structural_levels` for levels,
        `levels_coverage_for_bars` for whether an empty result is a fault or
        a reading), and writes the outcome.

        DELIBERATELY runs AFTER `_midday_execute_llm_actions`. Every exit
        decision this session makes has already been made and vetoed against
        `metric_deltas` built before this point, so a revision cannot reach
        them even in principle. That is the second of two independent
        defences; the first is that progress/pace are measured against the
        entry `initial_take_profit` (see `_build_position_facts`), so a
        revision cannot move a guarded metric at all. It can still reach
        a LATER session's reviewing model as prose, through
        `distance_to_target_pct`; what no deterministic gate does is read
        it.

        EVERY flag produces a durable row — a re-derivation, a named refusal,
        or a named data fault. Never a silent no-op and never a blank.
        Returns the outcome payloads for the session result / cockpit.

        Never raises: a failure here must not take down a review that has
        already executed its orders.
