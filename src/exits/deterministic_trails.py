        Trailing is arithmetic. Running it here means the reviewer's
        discretionary `TRAIL_STOP` becomes an override for the unusual case
        rather than the only mechanism, and the stop a winner rides up behind
        no longer depends on a model remembering to propose it.

        Every proposal is bounded by `src/risk/trailing.py`: ratchet upward
        only, a minimum move worth an order, and never inside one ordinary
        day's range. Returns the broker orders placed.

        Every evaluation also names WHY its position did or did not trail,
        and that reason is written to `specialist_evidence`
        (`kind='trail_state'`) whenever it differs from the last one on file

            # window that sees a pre-add high of 108 proposes 96, which is
