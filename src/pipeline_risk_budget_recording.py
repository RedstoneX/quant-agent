"""Board item 186 — where the concentration recording is taken.

One call site, replacing the realised-sector-weight call in
`src/stage_decision.py` rather than sitting beside it, so the recording adds
no lines to files the rebuild's size ratchet is shrinking. Both recordings
are taken at the same moment and for the same reason: it is the first point
at which the FINISHED order list and the allocator's result both exist.

RECORDING ONLY. Nothing here decides anything and nothing reads these rows
back into a sizing, ordering or refusal decision.
