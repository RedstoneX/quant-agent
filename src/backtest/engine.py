"""Deterministic-layer backtest engine.

`src/replay.py` replays past LLM decisions; it is not a strategy backtest
(docs/QAMC_REMEDIATION_SPEC.md §7.1). Without one, every change to stop
placement, sizing, or the risk budget is a guess evaluated against one noisy
live day, and a bad change is indistinguishable from a bad week.

SCOPE — read this before reading a number out of this module
-------------------------------------------------------------
This engine does NOT replay the LLM agents. Their outputs are not
reproducible (same prompt, different day, different answer), so there is no
honest way to "backtest" a Portfolio Manager or Tech Analyst call. What CAN
be measured, and what nearly every recent engineering change has actually
touched, is the DETERMINISTIC layer underneath them:

  * entry timing        — `RiskGate._has_actionable_signal_fn`
  * structural stops     — `src/data/levels.py::find_structural_levels`
  * stop discipline      — `PortfolioConstructor._resolve_stop` /
                            `._widen_stop_past_noise` (src/portfolio_constructor.py)
  * position sizing       — the §2.1 risk formula
                            (shares = equity x risk_pct/100 / |entry - stop|)
  * the portfolio risk budget and cluster caps
                          — `src/risk/budget.py::allocate_risk_budget`
                            (the function runs; on a binding day this
                            engine's equal-size unranked asks are served
                            alphabetically, not production's ranking —
                            see OTHER DECLARED SIMPLIFICATIONS)
  * trailing stops        — `src/risk/trailing.py::compute_trailing_stop`

Every one of those is reused from the live modules, not reimplemented, so a
change in this tool's output is attributable to the deterministic change
under test and nothing else. The one piece with no live counterpart to call
is "which structural level would the Tech Analyst have picked as the stop":
in production an LLM chooses among the levels `find_structural_levels`
reports. This engine substitutes a fixed, deterministic rule — the nearest
support below the NEXT DAY'S OPEN — the price this engine actually fills
at — for a long (nearest resistance above it for a short) becomes the
analyst's `stop_loss`, and the nearest level on the other side of that same
open becomes `reference_target`. ONE reference price for the whole entry
decision: the level partition, the ATR noise band, the reward:risk check
and the sizing all read the same number. No look-ahead is added — the stop
was already resolved against that open before sizing; only the level
partition used to disagree, against the signal-day close. When no level
defends the entry the stop is no longer refused: `None` goes to the real
`_widen_stop_past_noise`, which reads the stop from the instrument (the
wider of the ATR noise band and the signal bar's far edge, `signal_bar_low`
/ `signal_bar_high` set here from the SIGNAL day's bar), exactly as live.
Whatever comes out is fed through the REAL `_resolve_stop` /
`_widen_stop_past_noise`, exactly as the live constructor would if the
analyst had reported those numbers. `setup_type`
("range" vs "breakout") is likewise substituted deterministically from
`MarketContext.is_consolidating` (src/data/context.py) rather than an LLM's
chart read. Both substitutions are declared here, not hidden in a helper.

NO-LOOK-AHEAD
-------------
A signal computed from bars through day D is only ever acted on at day D+1's
OPEN — never at day D's own close, and never using anything dated after D+1's
open. Stops and targets are resolved from information available at the close
of day D. Indicators, structural levels and trailing-stop updates for day D
use bars [.., D] inclusive, never a bar past D.

DIRECTION
---------
The engine is direction-aware end to end (long and short fills, stops,
exits, signed P&L) so a later change that lands short trading does not need
this rewritten. The historical run in this repo's current state only ever
emits LONG signals, because the live system cannot open a short yet and the
deterministic prefilter/structural-levels path this engine reuses has no
short-side entry rule to borrow (mirroring one here, with nothing live to
validate it against, is not "reuse" — it's a new invention this backtester
declined to make). The short side of the engine is exercised directly by
`tests/test_backtest.py` with synthetic trades, not by the real-data run.

Also note: `PortfolioConstructor._widen_stop_past_noise` is long-only math
(it computes `entry_price - multiple * atr`, a floor BELOW entry). It is
reused as-is for longs. For shorts, this engine applies the raw structural
stop without a noise-band widening step — production has no short-side
widening rule yet to reuse, and this tool does not invent one.

OTHER DECLARED SIMPLIFICATIONS
-------------------------------
* One open position per symbol at a time (no pyramiding).
* Correlation clusters are recomputed once per simulated day, from bars
  through that day only (no look-ahead), using the same
  `build_correlation_matrix` / `correlation_clusters` the live risk budget
  uses.
* Equity used for sizing and for the risk budget compounds with REALIZED
  trade P&L only; unrealized marks on open positions are not folded in
  (matches the trade-level max-drawdown methodology in `metrics.py`).
* macro regime is not modelled — `_widen_stop_past_noise` is called with
  `regime=None`, i.e. no regime scale is applied.
* When a day's bar could have hit BOTH the stop and the target, the engine
  assumes the STOP was hit first. Daily OHLC cannot resolve true intrabar
  sequence, and assuming the worse outcome is the conservative choice.
* A position still open when the data window ends is force-closed at the
  last available close (`exit_reason="end_of_data"`), not silently dropped.
* Every new candidate requests the same `max_position_risk_pct` and this
  engine supplies no ranking (`priority` is omitted). When the budget
  binds, equal-size requests are served by the allocator's alphabetical
  ticker tie-break — ticker spelling, not a quality ranking. Production
  spends down `rank_verdicts` order; this engine has no verdicts and does
  not invent a score. Every run reports how many entry days bound; those
  days cannot evaluate live rationing. The share is not a discount you
  can apply to the other numbers: who got funded changes later equity,
  later size, and later outcomes.

  Every run ALSO reports `contested_budget_days`: the strictly narrower
  count of days on which two or more new candidates competed AND at
  least one was cut. Those are the days the alphabetical tie-break
  actually arbitrated between names. A day with a single candidate
  trimmed by already-held risk binds the budget but decides nothing by
  spelling, and production would have trimmed it the same way, so it is
  not contested. A run with ZERO contested days has no alphabetical
  arbitration anywhere in it and is therefore settleable; one with any
  contested day is reported as a NON-RESULT by the tool itself rather
  than left for a reader to disqualify. Zero is the line because this
  engine compounds equity off realized P&L: one funding call decided by
  spelling moves every later size and every later outcome, so there is
  no share of contested days that can be treated as noise around an
  otherwise sound number.

NOT SUBSTITUTED — why the asks stay equal
------------------------------------------
Production's `requested_pct` is `combined_override.value`
(src/portfolio_constructor/__init__.py), a conviction multiplier built
from the analyst and PM verdicts. There is no deterministic quantity in
this engine's reach that reproduces it. Making the asks differ per
candidate here would mean inventing a quality score, which is the one
thing this tool refuses to do, so the asks stay equal and the
consequence is DECLARED and COUNTED instead of disguised.

    `computed_levels` carries the levels §12.1's stop rule verifies against,
    the same field `TechAnalystAgent` sets in Python on the live path. This
    engine's stop candidate IS one of them, so without this the backtest
    would exercise the pre-§12.1 rule while claiming to run the real one.
    `computed_level_touches` is the touch count behind each of those prices
    (2026-09-03) — without it `_level_backing_stop` would honour every
    level regardless of `risk.min_level_touches_for_stop_honor`, which is
    not the rule the live path runs. The bar those counts are judged
    against is `config.risk.min_level_touches_for_stop_honor`, wired into
    this engine's `ConstructorConfig` in `run_backtest` — it was not wired
    before 2026-10-04, so this paragraph described a rule the engine was
    not actually running. `computed_level_bars` is the pivot-bar
    ranges behind those same prices — `_level_backing_stop` fails closed
    without them, so omitting it would make this engine refuse every
    level-backed stop that live honours.

    `setup_type` (already on the shim, and already required by the stop
    scaling in `_stop_atr_multiple`) is what carries docs/WORK.md item
    1(d) into the backtest for free, 2026-09-11: `_widen_stop_past_noise`
    reads it off this same shim, so a backtested breakout skips the
    reward:risk floor and a backtested range trade is no longer refused by
    it — the same rule live trading runs, from the same function, with no
    second copy. **One real caveat, and it is a parity gap that predates
    this change:** live, `setup_type` is the Technical Analyst's own chart
    read; here it is `_setup_type_for`'s deterministic
    `is_consolidating` proxy (see that function and the module docstring).
    The engine has no ranking stage at all — no PM, no verdicts — so the
