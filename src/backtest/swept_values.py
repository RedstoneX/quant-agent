"""Make a backtest sweep PROVE it reached the number it claims to vary.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Four separate times this project read a byte-identical
A/B result as "the parameter is inert" when the truth was "the harness
never reached the parameter". At least one of those values moved real
money materially once it was genuinely wired. A sweep that cannot show a
read count is a trap, because the two outcomes — inert value and
unreached value — are indistinguishable in the numbers.

So: every value this engine lets a sweep vary is read through a
`SweepMeter`, and every read is COUNTED at the site that actually uses
it. A run that reports ``0 reads`` for a value has not measured that
value; it has failed to reach it, and says so in its own output.

ONE METER PER RUN, NO STORED BOOKKEEPING. The meter hangs off
`BacktestParams`, which is already built once per run and threaded
through the engine, so a count is born and dies with the run it
describes. There is no module-level accumulator here: nothing survives
the run, so nothing can leak into the next one or be reset dishonestly.

THE TWO WAYS A VALUE GOES UNREAD, both found in this codebase:

1. ``from X import NAME`` binds the VALUE into the importing module's
   namespace at import time. Reassigning ``X.NAME`` afterwards changes
   nothing the importer sees. ``compute_trailing_stop`` (which lives in
   ``src/risk/trail_evaluate.py``, not in ``src/risk/trailing.py`` where
   its constants are defined) reads its chandelier and noise-band
   multiples this way.

2. ``def f(..., knob=MODULE_CONSTANT)`` evaluates the default ONCE, at
   function-definition time. ``find_structural_levels`` freezes its
   ``pivot_window`` / ``tolerance_pct`` / ``min_touches`` this way, so a
   sweep that reassigns the module constant is swept past silently.

The repairs are ENGINE-SIDE ONLY and change no value and no trading
rule. For (2) the engine passes the knobs EXPLICITLY on every call, read
late from the defining module, so a reassignment is honoured and
counted. For (1) `SweepMeter.counting()` installs a counting wrapper of
the SAME numeric value into the namespace that actually reads it, for
the duration of one run only, and restores the original afterwards.

NOTHING HERE RAISES. A diagnostic that halts a backtest is worse than
the problem it reports. A zero count is reported, never enforced.
