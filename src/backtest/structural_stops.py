    """Nearest structural level on the protective side of `entry_price`
    becomes the stop candidate; the nearest level on the other side of it
    becomes the reference target. A `None` stop is NOT a refusal: it means
    no level defends this entry, and the caller hands `None` to the real
    `_widen_stop_past_noise`, which reads the stop from the instrument —
    exactly what `_resolve_stop` does live (item 54).

    ONE REFERENCE PRICE. `entry_price` is the NEXT day's open, the price
    this engine actually fills at, and it is the only price the levels are
    partitioned against. It was previously the signal day's close for the
    level partition and the next open everywhere else (sizing, the noise
    band, the reward:risk check), so a gap through a level put the stop on
    the wrong side of what was paid. This is NOT look-ahead: the engine
    already resolved the whole stop against this same next-day open before
    sizing, and the level choice is part of that same at-the-open decision.
    The LEVELS themselves still come only from bars through the signal day.

    The third element is every computed level, supports and resistances
    unioned — the same shape `TechAnalysisResult.computed_levels` carries in
    live. Spec §12.1 keys the stop rule off it, so without it this engine
    would silently measure the OLD behaviour and the parity claim in the
    module docstring would stop being true.

    The fourth element is the touch count behind each of those prices — the
    same shape `TechAnalysisResult.computed_level_touches` carries in live
    (Phase 12.1, 2026-09-03). Without it this engine would honour a
    level-backed stop regardless of touch count while the live path enforces
    `risk.min_level_touches_for_stop_honor`, which is not the same rule.

    The fifth element is the high-low range of every bar that DREW each of
    those levels — the same shape `TechAnalysisResult.computed_level_bars`
    carries in live (docs/WORK.md items 55/215). The live stop rule asks
    whether the stop rests on one of those bars, and fails closed when the
    ranges are absent; an engine that did not carry them would refuse every
    level-backed stop while live honoured it, which is the opposite of the
    parity this function exists to keep."""
