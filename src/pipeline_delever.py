"""The Spec §11.2 gross-exposure ceiling and the de-levering ladder -- shims only.

Bodies live in src/delever/ (five constructed parts: ladder, conviction, enforce,
forced, trims); this mixin keeps same-named thin shims, built per call so a
collaborator swapped after construction is what the body sees. The two owner
alerts (`_alert_owner_force_delever_incomplete`, `_alert_owner_delever_incomplete`)
still carry their bodies here and are handed into the parts as collaborators.

The module-level names below are re-exported unchanged for importers and patchers
of this module (the ONE mirror block for this module): the risk-number helpers
`_optional_risk_number` / `_risk_number` now live in src/delever/risk_number.py and
are still imported from here by `src.pipeline_config_build` and `src.pipeline_risk_gate`.

Nothing here may import `src.pipeline`: this module is one of its bases.

        `_enforce_gross_ceiling` already logs a warning the moment it
        *decides* to trim. What nothing checked before this is the OUTCOME:
        a trim can be submitted and still leave the book over the ceiling —
        an order that failed to place, a partial fill, integer-share
        rounding down, or the market moving between the plan and the fill
        can all produce this. That gap is unreportable, not silent: it was
        always in the log, just never in anything the owner actually reads
        (a Telegram message) or in the session result a test can assert on.
        This is a reporting-only check — it runs after every broker call in
        the de-lever is already done and changes no order, no sizing, and no
        sequencing.

        Sets `ctx.leverage["delever_incomplete"] = True` (which every
        session-result dict already threads through, since they all copy
        `ctx.leverage` verbatim) whenever we have a real, freshly-measured
        gross exposure that is still above the ceiling. Never guesses: both
        numbers come from the same post-refresh `_resolve_gross_ceiling`
        call used for the ordinary leverage line, and the check is skipped
        (not defaulted to False) when either is unmeasurable.

        Item 112: promoted from a one-line session bullet to a STANDALONE
        `send_owner_alert`, mirroring the sibling
        `_alert_owner_force_delever_incomplete` — a book left over its
        ceiling after the ladder ran is the same class of unattended
        margin risk. The page is guarded by a STATE CHANGE: it fires only on
        the transition INTO still-over (prior recorded state was cleared or
        absent), so a book that sits over the ceiling for days does not page
        every session. The flag, the log line and the shortfall evidence
        record are unchanged — they still happen every session it is over;
        only the owner PAGE is edge-triggered. No "keep selling" behaviour is
        added here (owner-escalated, out of scope), and no global throttle is
        added to `send_owner_alert`.
