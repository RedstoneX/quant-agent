"""`build_risk_gate` — a `RiskGate` from values, not a pipeline.

Conversion step 7, finished. The old `RiskGateMixin`
(`src/pipeline_risk_gate_mixin.py`, deleted 2026-10-05) forwarded seven names
off `TradingPipeline` into a `RiskGate` it resolved per call from `self`. That
is the cosmetic split: the gate could not be had without a pipeline in hand.
This builder takes the four collaborators BY VALUE, so the gate can be
constructed, driven and tested with no pipeline anywhere — see
`tests/test_boundary_risk_gate.py`, which proves in a subprocess that building
it never imports `src.pipeline`.

`sweeper` is a zero-argument callable returning the cash sweeper or None; a
caller with none gets a gate whose sweep hooks are structural no-ops.
