"""Record the pending entry row for a BUY / SHORT before the order is submitted.

Lifted verbatim out of ``ExecutionStage._run_session`` (src/stage_execution.py)
so the row the orphan sweep reconciles against can be written and exercised
with a stub database -- nothing here needs the pipeline. Every collaborator is
an explicit keyword-only argument.

The three conviction-ledger fields that a settlement recording pins at entry
(``stop_basis``, ``entry_atr``, ``requested_risk_pct``) are read through
``pinned_evidence`` so a renamed or missing field FAILS here instead of
quietly storing NULL for the life of the feature (see src/recording_accessors.py).
