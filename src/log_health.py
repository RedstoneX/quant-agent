"""Read the desk's own application log for a window and say, in plain words,
whether the desk is healthy, degraded or hurt.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The owner reads Telegram and nothing else. Everything in
`quant_agent.log` that is not routed through an explicit owner alert reaches
nobody, and the two worst classes of fault on this desk have both been of
exactly that kind: a feed that failed every single time it was tried for a
fortnight (`Feed AP Business fetch failed: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden`,
53 occurrences, 2026-08-14 to 2026-08-28, verified in the rotated logs) and a
broker socket that was refused 11,427 times in one day
(`server rejected WebSocket connection: HTTP 429`, 2026-09-15, verified in
`quant_agent.log.3`). Neither produced a single message he saw.

THE SEVERITY RULE, AND WHY IT IS SHAPED THIS WAY.
This desk has a standing doctrine that a deliberate, correct refusal is NOT a
fault. A session that declines every candidate because the reward:risk did not
clear the bar has worked perfectly, and dressing that up as an incident trains
the owner to ignore the channel — which is the only channel he has. So a
refusal, a handled data drop, a retry that succeeded, and a cost figure that
was reconciled are all INFORMATIONAL and never produce a bullet.

But the same doctrine says a quiet day that is really a broken day must never
read as healthy. The failure mode that has actually bitten this desk is not a
loud crash; it is a warning nobody is subscribed to, repeated until it becomes
the background. So the bar for reporting is deliberately NOT "is it noisy" and
NOT a count. It is one of four conditions, each of which is a statement about
consequence rather than volume:

  COST_A_DECISION      — the desk was unable to decide something it set out to
                         decide. A skipped decision and a name that silently
                         fell out of a seat's answer are the same injury: the
                         desk acted on a view it did not actually form.
  MONEY_UNPROTECTED    — a position was left, for any length of time, without
                         the protective stop the desk believes is on it. This
                         is the only class where the loss is unbounded, so it
                         is always reported and always drives the verdict.
  PROVIDER_REJECTED_US — the broker or a data provider refused us. We cannot
                         fix it by trying harder and it invalidates the desk's
                         assumption that it can act when it decides to.
  SILENTLY_FAILING     — it has failed every time it was tried for long enough
                         that the desk's apparent health is misleading. This is
                         reported PRECISELY BECAUSE it is quiet: the longer it
                         has been true, the more the silence has been read as
                         health. Severity here is a function of duration, which
                         is measured from the logs, not assumed.

Anything that does not meet one of those four is not reported at all.

NO INVENTED LIMITS. The number of bullets is whatever the desk actually has
wrong — that is a measurement, not a setting, and if it is nine then nine is
the signal. The single length ceiling encoded here is Telegram's own published
per-message limit of 4,096 characters (Bot API `sendMessage`, `text` field),
consumed via `TelegramNotifier.MAX_MESSAGE_CHARS` so this module does not carry
a second copy of it. When a report will not fit, it SPLITS by severity — the
serious findings in the first message, the rest in a second — rather than
dropping a real fault to fit, which would reproduce the exact "looks quiet but
is not" failure the report exists to prevent.

A FALSE ALARM IS NOT A SMALL ERROR. The first version of this module shipped
three, all found by reading its matched lines against the log by hand:

  * it counted the macro seat's own prompt — an INFO line stating FULL data
    coverage — as an economics failure, because the words matched;
  * it told the owner his broker credentials were a fill-this-in stand-in,
    in the present tense, from an alarm that fired three minutes before he
    wrote the real keys and eleven minutes before the desk placed real orders
    with them;
  * it made "thirteen holdings left without their safety net" the headline of
    a morning on which nine sub-share stops went missing and every one was
    repaired, seven of them within the same second.

Three rules came out of that, and they are why this module is shaped as it is.
First, a REPORTABLE family only matches a line the desk itself logged as
WARNING or worse: text alone is not evidence that something went wrong.
Second, a family can name the thing it is ABOUT and the lines that CANCEL it,
so a fault repaired inside the window is not reported — matched per holding,
because seven repairs out of nine is two still open, not none. Third, every
bullet says when the fault last happened and never asserts a present state,
because a log line is evidence about a moment and several of these alarms are
rate-limited to once a day, which makes their absence meaningless too.

FAIL-CLOSED. Matching log text with regular expressions is matching against an
interface that can change wording without warning; a renamed message would
silently stop being counted and the report would read healthy. So every ERROR
and CRITICAL line in the window that matches no known family is itself counted
as a family (`unrecognised_faults`) and reported. The health check cannot
quietly stop working.
