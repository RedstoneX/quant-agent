    Two, and the union of them is the precondition (see the module
    docstring for why the union and not the binding one alone):

      * `risk_budget` — `allocate_risk_budget`'s headroom against the
        EXISTING book is already under the minimum this desk will size a
        new idea at. This is the original test, unchanged and still in
        force; it has simply stopped being the only one.
      * `funding` — the dollars `_entry_deployment_budget` says may still
        be deployed will not fund even the smallest position that can
        carry the owner's minimum risk per position. That one
        figure already carries the §11.2 gross ladder, settled cash, and
        the min of the two when margin is disabled, so a single test covers
        both the ladder and the cash constraint without this module
        computing either.

    `entry_budget_usd` / `min_entry_usd` of `None` mean the funding view was
    not resolvable this session; the funding test is then simply absent
    rather than guessed at, exactly as `existing_risk_pct=None` already
    disables the risk test. Silence from an unreadable input must not read

    2026-09-23, adversary review. `rotation_binding_constraints` returning
    `()` means "nothing is binding", and the prompt, the owner's report and
    the refusal row all render that as "there is room". When the funding
    figure was never resolvable, `()` would therefore have ASSERTED cash and
    borrowing room from a number nobody read — and the direction is adverse,
    because `_entry_deployment_budget` reports `ladder_backed=False` exactly
    when the gross ceiling is unresolvable, which is the branch where
    execution falls back to raw settled cash and is MOST constrained.

    So the three renderers ask this and say "not measured" rather than "there
    is room". The fallback has never fired in the retained logs (zero
    occurrences of the ladder-unreadable warning), which under this desk's
    own rule is a reason to make it safe, not a reason to trust it.
