# owner-facing account of the pre-check (board item: the missing "why not")
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The pre-check runs every session and its result reached NOTHING the owner
# reads. Worse, its commonest outcome — capital constrained AND no candidate
# good enough to sell a holding for — returned silently from
# `_apply_rotation_execution`, so it left no log line and no durable row
# either. The owner's words (2026-09-23): "Yes portfolio is full. But we're
# still reviewing things, which is how we built it. Report has to show that
# properly."
#
# ONE vocabulary, two consumers. `precheck_record` turns the pre-check into
# the durable audit row; `owner_precheck_lines` renders THAT SAME row for the
# owner. The model-facing prompt text in
# `PortfolioManagerAgent._render_rotation_section` is deliberately left
# byte-for-byte alone — rewording a live seat's prompt is a behaviour change
# on a trading path — but the four cases below are the same four cases it
# branches on, in the same order, and `tests/test_rotation.py` holds them to
# that.

#: The four mutually exclusive outcomes of one pre-check. A `reason` value,
#: i.e. a rule name and never prose — the same split `pm_accounting` uses.

#: constrained" refusal, so a below-bar holding can be put up to be cut with

#: the outranked case and must never borrow its sentence: there is nothing
