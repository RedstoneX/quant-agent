# A NORMAL OPERATING STATE IS NOT AN ERROR (owner, 2026-09-23).
#
# Every execution-skip `reason` below is a desk rule declining to place an
# order ON PURPOSE. The risk system refusing a trade it is built to refuse
# is the risk system working, and a session whose only blocks are these did
# not fail — it decided. The measured cases that forced this: "⚡ INTRADAY
# OPPORTUNITY · 9:49 AM ET · FAILED" on 2026-09-21 whose single block was
# `short_add_blocked`, and "🔵 MORNING · 9:36 AM ET · FAILED" on 2026-09-22
# whose only two blocks were the 200-session history pre-check refusing DRAM
# and CBRS while the PM's own verdict was `no_trades`.
#
# THE SET IS AN ALLOWLIST AND IT IS DELIBERATELY SHORT. Anything not named
# here — `broker_rejected`, `no_price`, `submit_failed`, a code added by a
# future change, a code this map has never seen — is classified as a FAULT
# and keeps the loud header. Getting a refusal wrongly called a failure is
# noise; getting a failure wrongly called a refusal is the owner not being
# told his desk broke, so the unknown case must fall the loud way.
#
# WHAT IS NOT ON IT, AND WHY — each of these was proposed for this set and
# thrown out against the production database on 2026-09-23:
#
#   slippage_gated / latency_window  NO LONGER PRODUCED on the quote path
#     (board item 183, 2026-09-30): the far-through-quote skip that emitted
#     them was deleted after all 8 recorded firings measured as venue noise
#     rather than a market that had run, and a displayed quote through the
#     entry ceiling is now recorded as `venue_quote_through_ceiling` with
#     the order still sent. `latency_window` survives on its own, separate
#     submit-window-overrun path. Both codes stay mapped below because
#     stored runs re-render through this table. The original finding, which
#     this deletion acts on: every one of the six `slippage_gated`
#     rows in the database is a venue-data problem wearing a policy code:
#     IEX asks 391, 405, 437, 488, 580 bp above reference against a 40bp
#     ceiling, on an account whose own code comments record that IEX
#     top-of-book is routinely stale. The 2026-09-15 run lost four
#     risk-approved buys this way; calling that session a correct no-trade
#     is exactly the cover story the desk's own doctrine forbids. The two
#     codes are also not independently determined — `src/pipeline_stages.py`
#     picks between them on `ctx.desk_latency_stall`, which is set at six
#     sites and cleared at none, so one stall anywhere in a run relabels
#     every later quote refusal in it.
#   short_add_blocked  Its own detail string reads "adding to a short is
#     not built". An unbuilt feature the desk keeps trying to use is not a
#     decision; it is the desk failing to act on its own signal, five times
#     on FLNC on 2026-09-21 alone.
#   geometry_rr  Dead. `_execution_payoff_skip_reason` returns None
#     unconditionally and its docstring says the token is not emitted. It
#     survives only in stored runs, which `render_stored_session_report`
#     re-renders through this code — so whitelisting it would retroactively
#     relabel the two historical reward:risk refusals as correct.
#   stale_entry  Zero rows in the entire database. Assigning owner-facing
#     meaning to a path that has never once run is a guess.
#   borrow_gate  A failed broker asset lookup is synthesised into
#     `{"shortable": False, "reason": "asset_lookup_failed"}` and filed
#     under this code, so an API failure would read as a borrow decision.
#   insufficient_cash / unusable_stop / bad_quantity / fat_finger_guard
#     "no cash", "no usable stop", "absurd quantity", "absurd price" must all
#     be said loudly: a guard firing means something upstream went wrong.

         a named ground" seven-tenths of a second before telling the owner,
         sixty-eight times over, that it "did not record why".
      2. Failing that, a HOLD order the PM wrote its own reasoning on.

    The accounting row's CODE is never shown; `pm_accounting.plain_reason`
    turns it into the sentence a person would use.

    Returns `(ground, detail)`. The GROUND is the shared sentence the
    renderer groups on — several names die on the same one — and the DETAIL
    is that one name's own specifics, which must stay off the group header

    session leaves sixty-odd candidates here and most of them die on the
    SAME ground — on 2026-09-23, thirty-nine of sixty-nine on one.

    WHY THERE ARE TIERS. Measured on run-fccb2026 (2026-09-23, replayed
    against the post-#600 code): this block alone renders 8,376 characters
    for 68 candidates, against a 4,000-character message budget. It was
    built first and took all of it, which is why the DETAILS block carrying
    the desk's actual reasoning rendered EMPTY in every live morning
    message. Clipping was not an option either: the clip would land
    mid-list and silently lose names.

    So the block degrades instead, and NO NAME IS EVER DROPPED at any tier
    — the #600 rule stands that a grouping which hides a name is a worse
    failure than a repetitive one. What is given up, in order, is the
    per-name detail sentence and then the one-name-per-line layout:

      tier 1  ground heading, then each name on its own line with its own
              detail sentence.
      tier 2  ground heading, then each name on its own line.
      tier 3  ground heading, then every name and its rating comma-joined
              on one line. Telegram soft-wraps it.
      tier 4  the same, tickers only.

    The company name goes before the rating because a ticker the owner does
    not recognise tells him nothing (board item 89), so it is the last
    thing given up rather than the first.

    Tier 4 is the FLOOR and is returned whatever `budget` says, because a
    block that renders nothing would put the owner back where #600 found
    him. The count in every heading still accounts for every candidate at
    every tier. `budget=None` means "no ceiling" — tier 1, the old
    behaviour, which is what the position-review and evening formatters
    and the stored-report replay path still get.
