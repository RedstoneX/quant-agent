# === intra_check cadence (2026-09-17) ===
#
# Owner requirement: "I want messages every hour. I want oversight and
# transparency of what is being done." Ticks still run every 30 minutes,
# unchanged — but a tick with nothing actionable (no order, trade, skip,
# fill, stop/coverage problem, or error) sends NO message at all, same as
# before AND now including the ":30 INTRADAY OPPORTUNITY ... NO TRADE"
# message, which used to always send. Silence on a quiet half-hour is fine;
# silence for a whole clock hour is not. The top-of-hour tick (":00", plus
# the 9:30 session-open tick, which is the first tick of the day and has no
# ":00" before it) is the guaranteed pulse: it ALWAYS sends one message,
# built from DB records covering the last ~hour — including the :30 tick's
# analysis, which ran under a different run_id than this tick's own — so
# the owner never goes more than a clock hour without a message, even on a
# fully quiet stretch. Anything actionable still sends immediately at any
# tick, exactly as before; if that already happened this hour, the
# top-of-hour tick still sends its own summary, as a second message body.
_HOUR_WINDOW_MINUTES = 70  # 60 minutes + a buffer for scheduler jitter

# 2026-09-17 regression, fixed same night: PR #454 moved intra_check's own
# systemd timer off the shared `*:0/30` tick onto `*:15,45` (to stop it
# firing in the same wall-clock second as morning/midday/close/evening —
# see scripts/systemd/quant-agent-intra_check.timer for the full story),
# but `_is_hourly_checkpoint` below still hard-coded `minute == 0` as "the
# top of the hour". intra_check is the ONLY session that runs this check
# (it is the one that ticks all day, 09:30-16:00 ET) and it no longer ever
# lands on minute 0 — so the owner's guaranteed once-per-hour message
# silently stopped firing on a quiet day. Never caught because nothing
# tied the checkpoint minute to the timer's actual cadence.
#
# Fix: the "top of the hour" is not minute 0, it is whatever minute
# intra_check's OWN timer first fires on each hour — read from the unit
# file itself (scripts/systemd/quant-agent-intra_check.timer) rather than
# duplicated here as a second hard-coded number, so the next cadence move
# carries the guarantee with it instead of quietly breaking it again. See
# tests/test_trader_feed.py::test_hourly_checkpoint_minute_matches_intra_check_timer_cadence
# for the guard that fails the build if this ever falls out of sync with
