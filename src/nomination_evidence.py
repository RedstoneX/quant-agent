"""One place that writes the `nomination_summary` evidence row.

The row was built three times inline in `src/stage_morning_research.py`,
once per exit path of the nomination responder pass, with the shared
fields copied each time. Copies drift, and the number ledger now depends
on this row carrying the nomination caps' demand measurement on EVERY
path -- a field present on two paths out of three measures nothing. So
the shared payload is assembled once here and each call site passes only
what is particular to its path.
