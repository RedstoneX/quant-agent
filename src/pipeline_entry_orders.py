    end-of-session cancel alert can say exactly what was tried.

    WHY ONE REPLACE, NOT A LADDER (rebuilt 2026-09-12, owner-approved).
    PR #311 walked the limit up in small steps, confirming each swap before
    the next. Two things from Alpaca's own community and docs retired that:
      * the practice real users converge on for a fast market is submit,
        wait a few seconds, then replace ONCE at a deliberately aggressive
        price that crosses the market — not a sequence of nudges that each
        arrive after the market has moved again;
      * every replace is another `pending_replace` window to get stuck in
        (a real user reported a position left unmanageable that way), so
        the number of replaces is exposure, and one is the minimum.

    WHAT "DECISIVE" MEANS HERE, WITH NO NEW NUMBER. The single reprice goes
    straight to the slippage CEILING — ``reference * (1 + max_entry_slippage
    _bps)`` — the price this entry was already approved to pay when it was
    gated at submission. A buy limit at the ceiling crosses any ask at or
    below it and executes at the ask, not at the limit, so it is the most
    aggressive legal price and costs nothing extra when the market is
    inside it. It is the ONE bound that was already there; no "cross by X
    cents" constant is invented on top of it. The ceiling is computed from
    the reference captured at submission, NOT a fresh quote, because a
    ceiling that follows the market is not a ceiling — and it is absolute:
    nothing here can price above it to force a fill.

    THE OPEN-MARKET DEFECT THIS FIXES. A replace against an order Alpaca has
    accepted but the exchange has not yet acknowledged is REJECTED
    ("unable to replace order, order isn't sent to exchange yet"). At the
    open — slowest acknowledgement, highest volatility, and when this desk
    trades most — the old first nudge at ~5s was the attempt most likely to
    be thrown away. So the reprice is now GATED on the order having left
    Alpaca's not-yet-at-exchange statuses (`accepted`, `pending_new`; see
    `AlpacaBroker._ORDER_PRE_EXCHANGE_STATES` for the sourced list), read
    from the same `trade_updates` websocket as the fill wait. If it never
    gets there inside the window, no replace is sent — that attempt would
    be rejected anyway — and the reason is recorded honestly.

    WHAT HAPPENS TO AN UNFILLED ORDER AFTERWARDS. It is NOT left working.
    `place_entry_protection` cancels any entry still working at the end of
    this session and pages the owner (see that method for the derivation:
    the cancel is bound to the desk's own session boundary, not a timeout).

    TIME. This adds at most ``2 * repeg_poll_seconds`` plus one replace
    round-trip before protection: one window to let the order work, and —
    only if the venue has not acknowledged it yet — one more to wait for
    that acknowledgement.

    THE FOOTGUN (unchanged). Alpaca does not edit an order in place. It
    cancels the old one and creates a NEW one with a NEW id:
      1. `trades.broker_order_id` must be repointed, write-ahead-logged
         (`pending_repegs`) so a crash mid-replace is recoverable.
      2. A partially filled order must NEVER be replaced — fill counters do
         not carry across a replacement. The fill is re-read immediately
         before the replace and any fill at all stops it.
      3. A replacement rejected because the order filled first is the good
         case; the original id stays authoritative.

    Never raises: a re-peg failing must leave the ordinary "protect whatever
    filled" path exactly as it was.

    decision list is filtered at least three more times — the symbol guard,
    the queued-earnings clamp, and the hard-risk gate — and each of those
    can remove SOME names while letting the rest through. A symbol removed
    by one of them was gone from the order list and absent from the frozen
    drop list, so the Risk Manager saw a plan arguing for a name it could
    not find and nothing telling it why. That is exactly the failure the
    drop list was written to prevent (docs/INCIDENT_HISTORY.md,
    2026-08-31), reappearing on a path the original fix did not cover.

    So it is recomputed right before the review instead. HOLD still counts
