"""Trade-review prompt facts: the prompt-facts seat HOLDS the standalone part instead of
inheriting a mixin.

The part is `PromptFactsReview` (src/prompt_facts/review/held.py); the fact bodies live on
the five family parts under src/prompt_facts/review/. `hold_prompt_facts_review(host_cls)`
installs one same-named instance-method delegate per review name, each forwarding to the
part built FOR that call (`review_of(host)`: the seat's current collaborators are read off the
instance and handed to `PromptFactsReview(**collaborators)`, so the part never sees the seat and
nothing goes stale between calls). Nothing is cached on the instance. The module-level names below
are re-exported unchanged for importers and patchers of this module (the ONE mirror block
for this module).
