        """PM memory: names it keeps asking for and never gets, and why.

        Every other per-symbol memory PM reads (loss pits, missed lessons,
        position history, R-multiples) is keyed on a POSITION, so a symbol
        that never became a position is invisible to all of them — however
        many times PM proposed it. This is the only section that can see a
        block, and a block is the cleanest feedback the desk produces: it
        arrives with its cause attached, where a filled trade's loss is
        confounded by whatever the market did next.

        Computed at prompt-build time from existing tables — no schema
        change. `specialist_evidence` marks each stage of a proposal's life
        and `decision_id` joins it to `trades`:

            target → proposed_order → verdict → execution_skip | trades.fill

        A `target` is one proposal. Targets sized to zero are EXIT
        instructions, not requests to get in, so they are excluded — a
        blocked exit is a different defect and counting it here would
        overstate the entry-side block rate.

        Every blocking reason is copied VERBATIM out of stored data —
        `execution_skip.reason` (`qty_zero`, `geometry_unmeasurable`,
        historical `geometry_rr`, `insufficient_cash`), `verdict.reason_category` (`rr_fail`, …),
        `trades.fill_status` (`canceled`, …) — so this section and the
        RM-verdict section name the same failure the same way. Exactly three
        tokens are ours: `rm_zeroed`, `order_not_placed` and
        `no_order_built`. Each describes an ABSENCE, which no table records:
        nothing was written, so nothing can be quoted. They are kept
        distinct because "the order was never built" and "the order was
        built and never placed" are different halves of the machinery.

        Conversion is judged on any `filled` trade sharing the proposal's
        `decision_id`. Today only entry orders carry a `decision_id`, so
        that is exact; if exits ever carry one, this biases toward calling a
        proposal converted, which makes the section quieter rather than
        making it cry wolf.

        Diagnostic only. Nothing here gates, filters or caps anything.
        That is final, not interim: a count-based re-proposal gate was
        ANSWERED NO on 2026-09-14 (docs/WORK.md item 10(b)) because the
        conversion rate measures this desk's own gates and plumbing, not
        the instrument. Do not add one.

        Returns "" when the window holds no proposals at all — PM's section
        then shows its own "no proposals on record" default. When there are
        proposals but no repeat offender, the aggregate line still renders
        with an explicit "none" so the desk can never mistake a quiet
        section for a missing one.
