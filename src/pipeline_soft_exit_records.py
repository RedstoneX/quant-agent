"""Soft-exit records (split out of src/pipeline_stages.py).

Moved VERBATIM out of `src/pipeline_stages.py`, following the pattern of
`src/pipeline_seat_evidence.py`: the open/increase missing-falsifier test and
the admitted-to-book filter, the mechanical soft-exit restore record and the
per-name soft-exit heal drain (board item 78), the missing-after-retry row,
the refusal count, and the last-resort isolate of BUY/SHORT names still
missing a falsifier after heal and retry. Every function takes the pipeline
and run context as plain arguments and reads each collaborator off that
handed-in host per call, so each can be exercised with stand-ins and no
`TradingPipeline` is ever built here
(`tests/test_boundary_pipeline_soft_exit_records.py` is the clause-5
witness). Every moved name is re-exported from `src.pipeline_stages` through
its one lazy re-export table, so each original import path and each test
patch target is unchanged; the write-through mirror on that module keeps a
patched name the same object on both sides.

The shared names below are imported FROM `src.pipeline_stages` as the stage
modules do (`_record_pipeline_event` resolves through that same lazy table to
`src.pipeline_candidate_records`); `src.pipeline_stages` imports this module
only lazily, by name, so the graph stays acyclic. Not in
`src.number_sources.SCOPED_PATHS`: the block carries no ledgered number site.
This module must not import `src.pipeline` and never reaches the broker seam.

    is schema + prompt + mechanical heal + one paid seat retry, then

    thesis_invalid_if or catalyst string. It does not delete the target
    — Risk must still be told the name was proposed and refused.

    EXACTLY WHAT WOULD JUSTIFY DELETING IT (board item 78, 2026-09-26).
    It stays until a LIVE session record shows all three. None of the
    three can be shown offline: each is a claim about what the seats
    really emit when real money is at stake.
      1. `specialist_evidence` holds ZERO `pipeline_event` rows with
         reason `soft-exit missing after retry`, over a window of live
         sessions that actually produced BUY/SHORT targets — not a window
         in which the desk simply proposed nothing. Zero refusals across
         zero opens proves nothing. [measured 2026-09-26: 0 such rows in
         4,709 pipeline_event rows spanning 2026-09-02 to 2026-09-26, so
         criterion 1 alone is already met and is NOT sufficient.]
      2. Over that same window no `soft_exit_heal` row carries outcome
         `paid_retry`: the heal being needed and working is not the same
         as the producing step producing. This is the criterion item 78
         actually names — Tech and the PM emitting a real falsifier
         unaided.
      3. No `soft_exit_heal` row in that window carries `not_attempted`,
         `cap_blocked` or `failed`. Each of those says the desk does not
         yet know whether the seat can fill the field, so a zero refusal
         count in their presence is silence, not evidence.
    Until all three hold, this stays. The heal and the durable heal record
    above are what keep it unreachable in normal operation.

    Catches empty AND `unknown` on BUY/SHORT — omitted empty is missing,
    not "the analyst had nothing to say". Neutrals, reductions and closes
    are not this filter. A constructed BUY/SHORT with a blank falsifier
    is still dropped even when `_target_intent` labelled the target a
    reduction (risk-down / weight-up from a tighter stop).
