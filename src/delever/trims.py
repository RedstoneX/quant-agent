Bodies moved verbatim from src/pipeline_delever.py (`DeleverMixin`), which keeps
same-named thin shims built per call. Every collaborator is an explicit keyword-only
constructor argument, so this builds and runs with no pipeline behind it. Collaborators
named after a sibling body (e.g. `_live_delever_price`) are the HOST's shim, handed in,
never a body this part owns, so no recursion guard is needed.
