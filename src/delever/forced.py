        """Safety net for `allow_margin=False` accounts: clear the measured
        cash deficit deterministically, without waiting on an LLM.

        When cash is meaningfully negative at session start we do NOT trust
        the LLM to pick which positions to cut — we force-sell worst-
        performing first (most negative unrealized P&L, largest size as
        tiebreaker), hedges last, until projected cash is ≥ 0. This runs
        BEFORE any decision / review stage, so the rest of the session
        operates on a clean, cash-only snapshot.

        The ordering is a biggest-loser-first P&L rule (owner-ratified), NOT
        a risk measure: the goal is to CLEAR THE MEASURED CASH DEFICIT, and
        cutting the worst performers first is simply how the desk chooses
        what to give up to do it. The only risk-shaped rule in the sort is
        keeping inverse-ETF hedges in the last tier (see the ordering block
        below), so raising the cash does not strip directional protection off
        the longs that remain.

        Rationale: the DE-LEVER MANDATE in the PM / midday prompts is
        advisory — if the LLM emits only HOLDs, margin sits. Users who opt
        in to `allow_margin=False` want structural enforcement, not an LLM
        nudge. Speed and safety > LLM judgment here.

        The sell is priced off the LIVE quote at submit time, not a fixed % of
        a possibly-stale mark: a marketable limit AT the live bid (crosses the
        spread, so it fills however far the name has gapped — the gap is in the
        quote), and a MARKET order when no live quote is available (the
        guaranteed fill). We prioritize fill over price when clearing an
        unintended margin position (docs/WORK.md item 118): a fixed % of a
        stale price rests ABOVE the falling market on a gap day and leaves the
        deficit uncleared. See `_live_delever_price`. Note the contrast with
        the deleted daily-loss liquidator (docs/WORK.md item 32): this path
        clears a MEASURED cash deficit of known size, not a whole book on a gap
        day, and it is reached only when `allow_margin` is false.

        Returns the submitted orders list (empty when no de-lever is needed).
        ctx.cash / positions / total_value are refreshed from broker after
        fills so downstream stages see truth.
