the risk-budget ceiling, the minimum order, the payoff skip reason, the

code, so it moves without one character of its bodies changing; every name
is re-exported from `src.pipeline_stages` so each original import path and

`_session_gross_ceiling` stays in `src/pipeline_stages.py` (the morning
prompt and the risk stage read it too). It is imported inside
`_entry_deployment_budget` rather than at module scope purely to keep the

# THE DEFECT THIS REPLACES (2026-09-02, the morning margin was switched on).
# The BUY submit loop clamped every entry against `available_cash`, seeded
# from the broker's RAW CASH figure, and that clamp was gated on NOTHING.
# Raw cash is at most `equity - gross`, so the arithmetic held gross below
# 1.0x equity STRUCTURALLY: however high `risk.max_gross_exposure_x` was
# set, a long could never cost more than settled money, and the §11.2
# ceiling could never become the binding constraint on the long side.
# `allow_margin: true` shipped that morning and changed nothing a long
# could do. Shorts were exempt (D11) and so were unaffected either way.
#
# THE CLAMP IS NOT REMOVED, and deleting it was considered and rejected.
# With margin enabled the broker ACCEPTS a buy that exceeds cash, so this
# loop is the last quantitative bound before the order leaves the building;
# with no clamp a batch of entries is bounded by nothing this side of
# Alpaca's own 4x. What changes is WHICH number is clamped against: the
# ladder-resolved gross headroom, so the de-levering ladder is the one
# number that governs how much the desk deploys.
#
# Fail-closed in all three degraded directions, because this gate is last:
#   - ladder unreadable  -> raw settled cash, i.e. exactly the pre-margin
#     behaviour. NEVER the standing 2.0x cap. The constructor may fall back
#     to the standing cap because another gate still runs after it; nothing
#     runs after this one.
#   - equity unusable    -> zero budget. `_resolve_gross_ceiling` already
#     forces the ladder's FLOOR rung on a non-finite equity read (guard 2,
#     2026-09-02) and alerts the owner; multiplying that rung by a NaN
#     equity would produce a NaN budget, every `>` comparison against it
#     would be False, and the clamp would silently grant INFINITE room on
#     precisely the broken-snapshot morning the guard exists for.

#     the headroom rather than inflating it.
