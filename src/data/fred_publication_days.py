"""Which calendar days FRED can actually publish a new print on.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`src/data/macro.py` derives, per series, the date by which a newer print is
due: `expected_next_by = last_observation + cadence + publication_lag`. That
arithmetic was plain calendar arithmetic, so the due date could land on a day
the publisher does not work, and the series was then judged against a date on
which nothing could ever have been published.

Measured false positive, from the production log
(`/home/qamc/quant-agent/quant_agent.log`, 2026-09-21 13:32:19 UTC):

    DFF: OVERDUE — latest reading is 2026-09-17; on this series' own cadence
    (1d between readings) and its own publication lag (1d) a newer print was
    due by 2026-09-19

2026-09-19 was a **Saturday**. The Federal Reserve Board's H.15 release, which
is where DFF comes from, publishes on business days only, so no print could
have landed on 2026-09-19 and none was missing. The desk nevertheless ran the
whole 2026-09-21 session on a macro seat that had downgraded itself — sixteen
separate prompt renderings that day carry "low confidence because DFF and
dollar-index inputs are overdue" (same log, 2026-09-21 13:34 UTC onward).

So the due date must be rolled forward off non-publication days before it is
compared with today. This module answers only that one question.

WHICH DAYS, AND ON WHAT AUTHORITY
---------------------------------
FRED is published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and the statistical
releases it redistributes come from federal agencies (Federal Reserve Board,
BLS, BEA, Census, Department of Labor). Those publishers observe:

* Saturdays and Sundays — no releases.
* The eleven federal holidays enumerated in 5 U.S.C. § 6103(a), with the
  weekend-observance rule of 5 U.S.C. § 6103(b) and Executive Order 11582:
  a holiday falling on a Saturday is observed on the preceding Friday, one
  falling on a Sunday is observed on the following Monday.

The holiday set is rule-based law, not a tuned parameter and not a table that
rots: every date below is computed from the statute's own description of the
day (`January 1`, `the third Monday in January`, ...), so this module needs no
network, no data file and no yearly maintenance.

WHAT THIS IS NOT
----------------
This is NOT the market calendar. `src/trading_calendar.py` deliberately keeps
exchange-holiday detection on the broker (`AlpacaBroker.is_trading_day()`)
because it needs a live connection, and the exchange calendar is not the same
as the federal one — Good Friday closes the NYSE and is not a federal holiday.
What matters for "has the statistical agency published yet?" is the federal
calendar, which is why this lives here rather than there.

This is also NOT the per-release schedule. FRED exposes real forward release
dates at `/fred/release/dates` (already used by `src/data/event_calendar.py`
for seven releases), which is strictly better information. It is not used here
because it costs an extra API call per series; rolling off non-publication days
is the part of that calendar that can be known for free and offline, and it is
the part the measured defect needed.
