        transient SEC errors.

        SEC enforces 10 req/sec via 429 (rate-limited) and returns 503
        when the service is overloaded. Before this retry loop, both
        errors raised HTTPError uncaught — caller's broad `except
        Exception` turned them into a silent empty filing list, which
        propagated to evening's `thesis_health_review` as missing 10-Q
        context (the core input for value-investing thesis decisions).

        Retries 429 / 503 / transient URLError with exponential backoff
        (1s, 2s, 4s). 404 / 400 / other 4xx-5xx propagate immediately —
        those mean the URL itself is wrong (bad CIK, missing filing),
        not a transient rate-limit, and retrying wastes the budget.

        `total_timeout_s` caps the worst-case time the loop can spend.
        Without it, 3 retries on a sustained SEC outage could burn
        REQUEST_DELAY(0.12s) + urlopen(15s) + backoff(1+2+4s) = ~21s × 3
        = ~63s per URL. With 77 stocks × 2 calls (submissions + filing
        body) that's hours of session time on a bad SEC day. 45s default
