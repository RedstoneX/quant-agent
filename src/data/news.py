# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Removed 2026-08-28: "Reuters Business" and "AP Business" — both wires were
# returning zero items (404 / 403 respectively) and, worse, failing SILENTLY:
# fetch_news() logged a warning per feed and reported the run as complete
# regardless. That silent-drop bug is fixed below (see NewsCoverage), but the
# two feeds themselves turned out not to be fixable for free. Investigated
# live the same day, with a plausible "just needs a real User-Agent" fix
# tried FIRST since a browser UA fixes the majority of anti-scraping 403s:
#
#   - Reuters ("https://www.reutersagency.com/feed/?best-topics=..."): a
#     browser UA changes nothing. Reuters killed public RSS in June 2020
#     (widely documented, e.g. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23576022
#     and https://www.fivefilters.org/2021/reuters-rss-feeds/). The URL
#     redirects (301) to reutersagency.com, which 200s but is now a HubSpot
#     marketing page selling paid Reuters Connect licensing — there is no
#     feed link left in the page at all, so this isn't a moved URL, it's a
#     retired product. reuters.com itself 401s on every path, including the
#     homepage, behind a DataDome JS/CAPTCHA wall (captcha-delivery.com) —
#     also not a User-Agent problem.
#   - AP ("https://rsshub.app/apnews/topics/business"): this was never AP's
#     own feed — rsshub.app is a third-party scraper that reformats AP's
#     site into RSS, and it is now sitting behind a Cloudflare managed JS
#     challenge ("Just a moment...", cRay/cZone markers in the response
#     body) that no User-Agent string can pass, since it requires executing
#     JS. AP's own site DOES advertise a real feed
#     (apnews.com/index.rss, found via <link rel="alternate"> autodiscovery)
#     but it answers HTTP 401 "Invalid client credentials" — that endpoint
#     now sits behind AP's paid Content/Breaking News API
#     (developerapi.ap.org, API key + OAuth2 required per AP's own
#     developer docs). Both AP's official route and the free proxy route
#     are dead.
#
# Net: the UA hypothesis was WRONG for both — the failures are a retired
# product (Reuters) and a paid-API gate plus a bot-walled proxy (AP), not a
# blocked header. Per the standing "no new paid dependency without owner
# approval" rule, this is a STOP-and-report, not a sign-up. If dedicated
# Reuters/AP wire coverage is wanted, that is an owner decision (Reuters
# Connect or the AP Content API, both paid) — tracked in docs/WORK.md rather
# than silently worked around.

# 2026-08-29 audit — every URL below was fetched live in this session,
# through the SAME code path production uses (urlopen + this module's
# USER_AGENT / SEC UA + FETCH_TIMEOUT), not just curled from a shell.
#
# REMOVED: "MarketWatch Markets" (feeds.marketwatch.com/marketwatch/
# marketpulse/) — returns HTTP 200 and parses as valid RSS, but its newest
# entry was dated 2025-07-03, i.e. it had been silently frozen for over a
# year. A 200 with year-old content is dead in every way that matters to
# this desk and NewsCoverage's "ok" would have hidden that fact, so it is
# removed rather than left in place returning stale-but-technically-valid
# data every run.
#
# ADDED (all verified live 2026-08-29, see the inline comment on each
# entry above): Seeking Alpha Market Currents, Investing.com News, Nasdaq
# News, SEC Press Releases.
#
# CHECKED AND REJECTED — fetched successfully but not added, or could not
# be fetched at all:
#   - SEC EDGAR "current events" filing feed (getcurrent&type=8-K, atom,
#     https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcurrent&type=8-K
#     &company=&dateb=&owner=include&count=100&output=atom): live, 100
#     items/fetch, but it is EVERY public filer's 8-K, not scoped to this
#     desk's ~101-symbol universe, and items are keyed by company name/CIK
#     rather than ticker so tag_symbol_mentions' word-boundary ticker match
#     mostly misses them. Sorted newest-first into a capped prompt, 100
#     mostly-irrelevant micro-cap filings would crowd out real wire
#     headlines from the same window. Left out; a CIK->ticker filtered
#     variant would be a reasonable follow-up but is a bigger change than
#     "add a feed."
#   - SEC Litigation Releases (https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/
#     litigation-releases/rss): live, 25 items, but title AND summary are
#     just the defendant's name (e.g. "Ichcoin Tech Corp.", "Stephen E.
#     Buyer, et al.") with no case description in the feed itself — this
#     pipeline reads headlines/summaries, not the linked page, so the feed
#     carries no usable signal as configured.
#   - Benzinga (https://www.benzinga.com/feed): live, 200, 10 items — but
#     the content is crypto price-prediction SEO posts ("Toncoin (TON)
#     Price Prediction 2025, 2026, 2027-2030") and affiliate content
#     ("Credible Review"), not equities/macro news. Rejected on content
#     quality, not reachability.
#   - Yahoo Finance per-symbol RSS (https://finance.yahoo.com/rss/
#     headline?s=AAPL) and Seeking Alpha per-symbol
#     (https://seekingalpha.com/api/sa/combined/AAPL.xml): both verified
#     live and working for a single symbol. NOT wired in: at the full
#     101-symbol trading.universe this is 101-202 extra HTTP requests to a
#     free public endpoint every run, with no documented rate-limit
#     tolerance — real hammering risk. Capping to "the symbols the desk
#     actually cares about this run" (positions + active candidates) would
#     need portfolio state plumbed into NewsDataProvider, which doesn't
#     have it today and doesn't construct it here — that is a scope/design
#     decision for the owner, not something to bolt on silently. Tracked
#     in docs/WORK.md rather than half-wired.
#
#     2026-08-30 UPDATE — the owner made that scope decision: free sources
#     only, scoped every run to held positions + this run's admitted
#     candidates (never the full universe), with a hard symbol cap so this
#     can never regress toward 101-202 requests. Re-verified live the same
#     day (through this exact module's fetch path, urlopen + USER_AGENT):
#     https://finance.yahoo.com/rss/headline?s=<TICKER> still 301-redirects
#     to feeds.finance.yahoo.com and returns HTTP 200 with valid RSS 2.0
#     (13-20 items/symbol across the 6 symbols in the live book that day —
#     see the PR description for the full per-symbol measurement). Wired in
#     below as `YAHOO_PER_SYMBOL_URL_TEMPLATE` /
#     `NewsDataProvider.fetch_news(symbols=...)`; caller-side selection and
#     all caps live in `config.news.per_symbol_*`
#     (src/config.py::NewsConfig). Seeking Alpha per-symbol remains
#     verified-available but is deliberately NOT enabled alongside it — one
#     request per symbol, not two, keeps the added request count halved.
#     This is a scope choice, not a disabled feature; flip it on only with
#     a matching second look at Seeking Alpha's own rate tolerance.
#   - GlobeNewswire (https://www.globenewswire.com/rss/list and the atom/
#     rss subject-code variants): every attempt (urlopen, curl, curl
#     --http1.1) either hung until timeout or dropped the HTTP/2 stream —
#     never got a parseable response in this session. Not added; not
#     reachable from here, not a content judgment.
#   - Business Wire (feed.businesswire.com/rss/home/?rss=...): HTTP 200
#     but 0 entries — the public example feed URL is a dead stub, not a
#     working general wire. Business Wire's real feeds are per-newsroom
#     and account-gated.
#   - U.S. Treasury press releases: every URL tried (home.treasury.gov/rss/
#     press-releases, /news/press-releases/rss.xml) 404s, and the live
#     press-releases HTML page has no RSS <link> autodiscovery tag either
#     — Treasury's public RSS appears to have been discontinued (their own
#     site carries a stale 2021 notice about the feed showing migrated old
#     releases). No working free URL found.
#   - BEA (bea.gov/rss.xml and variants): 404, no RSS discovered.
#   - BLS (bls.gov/feed/bls_latest.rss): returned HTTP 200 once, but a
#     repeat fetch in the same session got an "Access Denied" bot-block
#     page instead of the feed — BLS's WAF appears to rate-limit
#     automated fetches aggressively even at low volume. Combined with the
#     feed itself carrying exactly one generic aggregate item ("Major
#     Economic Indicators Latest Numbers", not real distinct headlines),
#     this is both a reliability risk and low content value. Not added.
#   - Nasdaq IR (ir.nasdaq.com/tools/rss-feeds) and NYSE: no reachable
#     public RSS found (ir.nasdaq.com did not respond in this session;
#     NYSE was not found to publish a public feed at all).
#   - Financial Modeling Prep / Finnhub / Alpha Vantage: all require an API
#     key for any endpoint beyond a bare ping/quota check. Per the
#     no-paid-signup rule this was not tested further and nothing was
#     signed up for — reported as needing a key, left out.

        Default lookback is 24h, fine for Tue-Fri morning runs. On Monday
        morning the previous trading day was Friday, so a 24h window
        misses ~72h of weekend news (Fed pressers, geopolitical events,
        earnings pre-announcements all routinely land on weekends). The
        Monday-aware path: if today is Monday, automatically extend the
        lookback to cover the gap. The caller can also override via
        `lookback_hours_override` for hand-tuning / replay scenarios.

        `symbols`, when given, is an already-ordered list of tickers to also
        fetch individually from Yahoo Finance's per-symbol RSS (2026-08-30
        owner decision — see the audit block above `USER_AGENT`). This
        provider is deliberately kept portfolio-agnostic: the caller (the
        pipeline, which knows held positions and the run's admitted
        candidates) decides WHICH symbols and in what order — positions
        before candidates is the documented convention, see
        TradingPipeline._run_news_update — and this method only decides HOW
        MANY, via `self.per_symbol_max_symbols`. That cap is enforced here
        regardless of how long `symbols` is, so a caller bug can never turn
        into a live request storm. Pass `None` or `[]` (or set
        `per_symbol_enabled=False`) for zero added requests and byte-identical
        behavior to a NewsDataProvider that has never heard of per-symbol
        fetching.

        Returns `(items, coverage)`. Before 2026-08-28 this returned only
        `items`, and a feed that failed simply contributed zero of them —
        indistinguishable from a feed that fetched fine and had nothing new
        to say. `NewsCoverage` is the fix: every caller now gets an explicit
        accounting of how many feeds were configured, how many actually
        returned data, and which ones failed and why, so "the wires were
        read" and "two wires returned nothing" can never again look the
        same downstream. Per-symbol feeds are folded into this SAME
        `NewsCoverage` (each symbol is just another named feed) rather than
        a parallel reporting path, so a per-symbol feed that starts failing
        shows up exactly the same way a dead general wire does.
