"""Congress (House + Senate) trading-disclosure smart-money provider.

Two independent, free, credentialless sources are cross-checked against
each other, matching the exact fail-open posture `SECForm4Provider` already
uses for SEC Form 4 (`src/data/smart_money.py`): a source going unreachable,
timing out or returning malformed data must never block a refresh or crash
the run, and this stream never gates a trade on its own (see
`SmartMoneyFinding`'s "conservative congressional contract" in
`src/models.py`, unchanged by this file).

Sources
-------
Primary   kadoa-org/congress-trading-monitor (GitHub, MIT licensed). Static
          JSON, no auth, no rate limit. Covers House Clerk PTRs, Senate eFD
          and OGE executive-branch filings, and carries a real
          ``filing_date`` per trade.
Secondary congresswatch.us (OpenSourcePatents LLC). No auth, ~8,000 records,
          House + Senate. Carries the official PTR link for provenance, but
          its live schema has NO filing/disclosure-date field at all (see
          `_normalize_congresswatch` below), and at least one observed
          record has a future-dated transaction — every date is sanity-
          checked (`_date_verdict`) before use, dropping rather than
          silently repairing an implausible one.

Reading incrementally
---------------------
Neither source can be asked for only what is new; both answer "unchanged"
to a conditional request. So a file is downloaded only when it changed, and
each row in it is processed once, ever. The evidence, and what is persisted
under ``data_dir``, are in the block above `_SOURCES` and on the class.

Both are single-operator, young projects with no track record: treat as
best-effort, never load-bearing, exactly like the free Form 4 discovery
path this seat already relies on.

Dedup and disagreement
-----------------------
The same real trade can appear in both feeds. Rows are grouped by
``(ticker, normalized filer name, transaction_date)`` — a "rough amount"
match is deliberately not part of the group key, because a genuine
disagreement about the dollar bracket is exactly the case this cross-check
exists to surface, not to hide by splitting into two rows. Within a group:

* one source only -> ``cross_source_agreement="single_source"``.
* both sources, same direction and overlapping amount bracket ->
  ``"agreement"``.
* both sources, but direction or amount bracket disagree -> ``"discrepancy"``,
  with `cross_source_note` stating what disagreed. The row is still kept
  (never dropped for disagreeing) and the analyst sees the flag.

Cluster/materiality reduction reuses the exact same window and helper as
SEC Form 4 (`src.data.smart_money_cluster.cluster_survivors`) — see that
module's docstring for why this is a shared function rather than two
independent implementations.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Neither source can be asked for "only records newer than X". Checked live,
# read-only, 2026-09-19:
#
#   kadoa          A static file on GitHub. The repository's data directory
#                  (GitHub contents API) holds only whole-file JSON
#                  (trades.json, filers.json, tickers.json, ...) and per-filer /
#                  per-ticker folders — nothing per date, no query interface.
#                  trades.json is the NEWEST 5,000 rows by filing date
#                  (filing dates 2026-07-01..2026-09-17 on 2026-09-19), so
#                  rows older than that slice fall out of the file entirely.
#                  Every row carries a stable `id`.
#   congresswatch  A static file on Vercel. `/api`, `/api/trades` and
#                  `/api/trades?since=` all 404; `trades.json?since=2026-09-01`
#                  returns the identical 8,231 rows. Rows carry NO id and NO
#                  filing date — only the transaction date, and new
#                  disclosures arrive with transaction dates weeks in the past
#                  (kadoa's real filing dates: median lag 60 days over 3,147
#                  rows, 2026-09-19), so no date on the row can serve as a
#                  skip-watermark.
#
# What both DO honour is an HTTP conditional request: sent back its own
# `ETag` (If-None-Match) or `Last-Modified` (If-Modified-Since), each
# answered `304 Not Modified` with zero bytes on 2026-09-19. So:
#
#   1. FETCH only when the file changed (conditional GET, both sources). An
#      unchanged morning downloads and processes nothing.
#   2. When it did change, the whole file comes down (it is one file; that
#      is all either source offers — congresswatch ~250 KB compressed; both
#      together under a second, measured 2026-09-19) but
#      each row is PROCESSED at most once: every row is keyed by a fingerprint
#      of the fields this module reads (plus kadoa's own `id`), the keys
#      already processed are persisted, and only unseen keys are parsed,
#      matched and turned into observations. A row dropped for a reason
#      (future-dated, no ticker, ...) is also remembered, so it is not
#      re-judged every day either.
#
# The per-source watermark recorded alongside is the newest date processed:
# kadoa's newest FILING date, congresswatch's newest TRANSACTION date. It is
# reported, never used to skip — the processed-key set is what skips, because
# a late filing can carry an older date than one already read.
