"""Deterministic support/resistance detection from completed daily bars.

Why this exists
---------------
Until 2026-08-27 the Tech Analyst was shown the last **20** daily bars and asked
to report "the two or three key levels". Twenty bars is one month: a
consolidation from six weeks ago, a swing high from last spring, a level price
has respected four times since — all invisible. The only things the analyst
could honestly cite were the moving averages and the 20-day high/low, so the
structural levels the whole exit system depends on were effectively absent, and
`PortfolioConstructor` invented stops and targets to fill the gap.

The history was never the problem: the pipeline already fetched hundreds of
bars to compute MA200, then showed the analyst twenty of them.

Finding where price repeatedly stopped is arithmetic, not judgment, so it
belongs here rather than in a language model. Computing five years of levels
costs single-digit milliseconds and zero tokens, and — unlike asking a model to
eyeball a wall of numbers — the same chart yields the same levels every time,
which is what makes the behaviour testable and back-testable.

The model still does the part it is good at: deciding which of these levels
matters right now, and what kind of setup the chart is showing.

# A pivot is a bar whose high (or low) is the most extreme within this many
# bars either side, for THIS module only.
#
# **This is a convention with no derivation.** The previous comment here
# ("5 keeps genuine swing structure while ignoring single-bar wiggles;
# smaller values produce noise, larger ones miss real turning points") read
# as a justification but was an unsourced assertion — it states the generic
# sensitivity tradeoff that applies to ANY window and picks 5 out of it,
# which is not a derivation of 5.
#
# The archetype is adopted, the constant is not. See the long note beside
# `src/risk/trailing.py::PIVOT_WINDOW` for the fetched sources (TA-Lib
# FRACTAL, MetaTrader 5, fxssi, LuxAlgo, reviewed 2026-09-13): every one of
# them states a bar count as convention and none derives it, TA-Lib's own
# default is 2 either side, and LuxAlgo states there is no universally best
# setting. So 5 stays, honestly labelled, rather than being changed to
# another number with no better claim.
#
# 2026-09-13, second pass (docs/WORK.md item 55): the ACADEMIC literature on
# this exact construction was found, and it does not derive the window either
# — but it does bound what is known. Tsinaslanidis, "Technical Trading
# Strategies, Pattern Recognition and Financial Risk Management" (PhD thesis,
# University of Macedonia, 2012, §4.3, the published method of Zapranis &
# Tsinaslanidis 2012a) defines a pivot exactly as this module does, as a
# symmetric rolling-window extreme: "in order to characterize the closing
# price observed at time t (Pt) as a regional peak, when a rolling window
# with a length of 50 days is used, this price has to be greater than the 25
# preceding and 25 following days simultaneously." The shape is the same; the
# scale is not. Their tested windows are 50, 100 and 150 days TOTAL — 25, 50
# and 75 bars either side — and they report the results "robust to any
# different parameterization" ACROSS THAT RANGE. Nothing in that finding
# reaches down to 3 or 5 bars either side, so it does not license this
# constant; it only says the object is insensitive somewhere else entirely.
# Two further differences that stop this being a like-for-like citation:
# they read CLOSES, this module reads highs and lows; and their window is
# tuned to identify multi-month swing structure, not the multi-day structure
# a stop sits on.
#
# `src/risk/trailing.py` uses 3, NOT 5, and that is not an error to fix by
# copying. Consumers of THIS window are `find_structural_levels` and
# `structure_coverage` in this file (and `MIN_SCAN_BARS` below, which is read
# from it). Nothing downstream compares a level computed here against a pivot
# found by `src/risk/trailing.py`, so the disagreement is currently harmless;
# `tests/test_pivot_window_independence.py` pins both that they differ and
# that no shared consumer exists.
PIVOT_WINDOW = 5

# The fewest CLEAN bars the level scan can run over — READ from the scan's

# ``ATR_PERIOD`` bars (`src/data/technical.py::atr_series` returns nothing
# below that). Whichever is larger is the scan's real minimum, and both
# `find_structural_levels` and `structure_coverage` read it from here so
# they can never disagree about whether the scan could have run. (Before
# this was unified, the scan needed 14 and the coverage check said 11.)

#
# That a level is a band and not a price is sourced, not assumed. Bulkowski,
# quoted in Tsinaslanidis (PhD thesis, University of Macedonia, 2012, §4.2):
# "Support and resistance are not individual price points, but rather thick
# bands of molasses that slow or even stop price movement." The same section
# derives the requirement from Murphy and Bulkowski together: "it can be
# inferred that a support or a resistant level is an area of prices, rather
# than a specific individual price level, in where local peaks and bottoms
# reside." So the SHAPE — a percentage-width band around a cluster of pivots
# — is the published archetype and is adopted here deliberately.
#
# The WIDTH is not derived by that literature. Its own construction (§4.4)
# leaves it as a user input: "The third variable 'x' is the desired
# percentage distance of each bin." What the literature does supply is a
# measured insensitivity range, and this desk sits at the edge of it. Their
# illustrated default is 3%, and footnote 32 records that "desired distances
# of 2%, 4% and 5% are also implemented", with the body stating "Any further
# parameterization does not affect the empirical findings" — measured over
# 733 NASDAQ/NYSE names, 1990-2010. `_cluster` below chains a pivot in when
# it sits within this percentage of the cluster's ANCHOR, so a cluster spans
# at most 1.0% — HALF the narrowest bin that literature has tested. The
# match zone built from it (`level_zone_halfwidth`, +/-1%) spans 2.0%, which
# is exactly that narrowest tested bin.
#
# So: 1.0 is not shown to be right, and it is not shown to be wrong either.
# It stays, labelled, rather than being moved to 3.0 — moving it would be
# adopting a foreign default, which is the same unsourced act in the other
# direction. What would settle it is named in docs/WORK.md item 55.
# SUPERSEDED 2026-09-30 (docs/WORK.md item 55). The clustering rule above is
# no longer a percentage at all: two pivots are the same level when the actual
# PRICE RANGES of the bars that made them OVERLAP, and the level's zone is
# those bars' own combined span (`_cluster`, `Level.zone_low/zone_high`). That
# is read off the instrument, so there is no width to pick and nothing left to
# sweep. The everything above about 1.0 vs 2%-5% bins is history, kept because
# it records why a number was there.
#
# This constant survives for ONE purpose: FAIL-CLOSED fallback. A caller that
# holds only a bare level PRICE with no zone attached (an older stored
# analysis, a fixture, any path that predates the zone field) still needs some
# bound, and silently dropping the level would remove a stop's structural
# backing. Such a caller gets exactly today's behaviour. It must never be used
# when a real zone is available.

    """Is `stop_price` AT this level, rather than merely inside its band?

    docs/WORK.md item 215. `level_zone_halfwidth` bounds the level's WHOLE
    zone, so "inside the zone" and "at the level" were reported as the same
    statement. They are not: a merged cluster's zone can span a fifth of the
    price, and a stop at one end of it can be taken out with the level itself
    never broken.

    The test here introduces NO new number. A level is drawn by the bars that
    turned at it; the smallest thing the instrument itself says is "structure
    traded here" is one of those bars' own high-low range. So the stop rests
    on the level when it lies inside the range of at least one bar that formed
    the level — a price the market actually defended — and not when it merely
    lies somewhere in the merged span between two distant pivots. The bound is
    read off the same bars `find_structural_levels` clustered, so it can never
    drift from the object it is matching.

    **THE OUTWARD BOUND (adversary pass, 2026-09-30).** Bar membership alone
    is NOT enough, and on its own it is a one-way loosening. The furthest a
    stop can sit from `Level.price` and still pass the membership test is the
    zone halfwidth exactly, because the zone edges ARE bar extremes and an
    extreme always lies inside some bar. Measured over the 704 levels this
    desk's own 400-bar set produces under the clustering in `_cluster`: median
    halfwidth 3.33% of price, p90 9.41%, max 36.07%; restricted to levels with
    at least 5 touches, median 4.31% and 38% of them above 5%. Against a hard
    1.00% on the prior rule. With the break check evaluating the matched LEVEL
    price rather than the stop, that permits "structure intact" reported with
    the stop a fifth of the price away. So membership needs a ceiling.

    `stop_distance` is that ceiling and it introduces NO number. It is
    ``abs(entry_price - stop_loss)`` — the trade's own risk, already decided
    before this question is asked. The rule: **the level must be more precise
    than the thing it is backing.** The level's measured zone (``min(low)`` to
    ``max(high)`` over `pivot_bars`, the same span `cluster_span` reports) must
    be STRICTLY NARROWER than the stop distance. Because the stop-to-level gap
    can never exceed that span, the bound guarantees
    ``abs(stop - level) < abs(entry - stop)``: the level a stop claims to rest
    on is never further from the stop than the stop is from the entry. The
    bound is a property of the trade, not a constant, so there is nothing to
    sweep and nothing to ratify.

    What it admits and refuses, measured on the same 704 levels, using the
    desk's own two existing stop floors as the stop distance (no new number is
    introduced by the measurement either): at a 1.0-ATR stop it admits 33/704
    levels (5%), and 1/154 of the >=5-touch levels; at a 2.5-ATR stop it admits
    465/704 (66%), and 63/154 (41%) of the >=5-touch levels. The levels it
    refuses at 2.5 ATR have median halfwidth 5.64% of price and reach 36.07%;
    the widest level it admits has halfwidth 13.41%, which is still inside the
    trade's own risk by construction. The exemption therefore becomes rare on
    tight stops, which is the honest consequence of refusing to pick a width:
    a level too vague to be more precise than the stop cannot earn a stop the
    right to be tighter than the noise floor.

    Fail closed, in both directions: no bar ranges, a non-finite stop, or a
    `stop_distance` that is missing, non-finite or non-positive all mean NOT
    backed, which routes the stop to the ordinary ATR floor exactly as an
    unmatched stop does today.

    pivots formed it — the answer is read straight off them and no
    percentage is involved. `tolerance_pct` is then ignored entirely.

    When they are absent or unusable the percentage fallback below applies,
    unchanged. That is deliberate and it is the fail-closed direction: a

    within, instead of a zero-width zone that would silently strip a real
    level out of stop placement.

    THE ONE definition of "a level is a zone, not a number", so no caller
    ever has to restate it in different units. docs/WORK.md item 46.

    Derivation, read straight off `_cluster` and `find_structural_levels`
    above — not chosen here:

      * On the fallback path `_cluster` admits a pivot only when it sits
        within `tolerance_pct` of EVERY member, and in particular of the
        group's anchor — its LOWEST member, since the pivots are swept in
        ascending price. So every member of such a cluster lies in
        ``[anchor, anchor * (1 + tolerance_pct/100)]`` and the cluster's
        full span is at most ``anchor * tolerance_pct/100``.
      * `Level.price` is the MEAN of the cluster, so it lies inside that span
        and ``anchor <= price``.
      * Therefore the distance from `Level.price` to the furthest real pivot
        in its own zone is at most ``anchor * tolerance_pct/100``, which is at
        most ``price * tolerance_pct/100``.

    That last line is the whole function: a bound that is guaranteed to cover
    the zone, in the same unit the zone was defined in. Anything asking "is
    this price AT that level" must use this and nothing else — a tolerance
    expressed in some other unit (ATRs, say) tracks a quantity that has no
    fixed relationship to `tolerance_pct` and silently stops covering the
    zone on any name whose volatility moves. That is exactly the defect item
    46 recorded.

# 15-session hold the MEDIAN per-name realised excursion is 1.93 ATR and
# the per-name MAXIMUM is 8.78 ATR, against this cap's 1.5*sqrt(15) =
# 5.81 ATR [measured 2026-10-01, rolling windows, ATR(14)].
#
# Two findings, both against replacing it:
#   1. The cap is NOT the binding constraint it was believed to be. At a
#      typical hold it sits at ~5.8 ATR while the instrument's own typical
#      advance is ~1.9 ATR, and recorded target distance is a median 3.25
#      ATR. It binds only in the tail, not on the ordinary trade. Said
#      plainly, because an earlier diagnosis in this repo says otherwise:
#      this cap is NOT what holds the desk's targets close.
#   2. A measured replacement still needs a QUANTILE -- median (1.93) and
#      maximum (8.78) differ by 4.5x and sit either side of today's value.
#      Picking between them is exactly the appetite choice the doctrine
#      bars, and the only choice-free statistic (the sample maximum) is an
#      outlier support bound, not a reach estimate.

    1. The reflection principle for the running maximum of Brownian motion:

    **The rule (item 55, 2026-09-30), and there is no number in it.** Two
    pivots belong to the same level when the price RANGES their bars actually
    traded overlap.

    **THE ACCEPTANCE TEST IS ALL-MEMBERS; THE PARTITION IS GREEDY FIRST-FIT,
    AND THE DIFFERENCE IS STATED HERE RATHER THAN GLOSSED.** A pivot joins a
    level only if its bar range overlaps the range of EVERY member already in
    it — never merely the nearest one. Equivalently, the members' ranges must
    share at least one common price: the running intersection
    ``[max(low), min(high)]`` stays non-empty. So every level names a price
    band that every one of its bars actually traded, and that invariant holds
    unconditionally.

    What this is NOT is agglomerative complete-linkage clustering, and an
    earlier version of this docstring said it was. The loop below sweeps the
    pivots in ascending price and puts each into the FIRST existing level that
    accepts it, so a pivot whose bar overlaps two levels joins the
    lower-priced one and the partition depends on the sweep order. True
    complete linkage would merge the globally closest pair at every step and
    is order-independent. The all-members acceptance test is what buys the
    anti-chaining property described below; the first-fit assignment is a
    deliberate, cheaper choice and the resulting partition is not claimed to
    be optimal. An untrue description of an algorithm is the same class of
    defect as an untrue alert, so it is written down rather than implied.

    Single linkage (chaining a pivot in when it reaches any one member) was
    tried first and is WRONG here for the reason this desk already wrote
    down in `src/data/news_dedup.py`: "single-linkage chaining is the classic
    way two distinct events get welded together through an intermediate
    article that resembles both." One tall bar spanning two unrelated shelves
    welds them into a level whose band covers neither. The assignment loop
    below is deliberately the same shape as `cluster_news`: try each existing
    level in order, require the candidate to pass against every member, and
    open a new level only when none accepts it.

    The level's width is then the members' own combined span — ``min(low)``
    to ``max(high)`` — measured, not assigned. That span can exceed the
    common intersection, and it is reported as it falls; nothing is capped,
    because a cap would be exactly the invented number this rule deletes.

    What this replaces, and why. Until today a pivot joined a group when its
    PRICE sat within `CLUSTER_TOLERANCE_PCT` (1%) of the group's anchor. That
    1% was never shown to be right (its own ledger entry said so), it did not
    scale with how violently a name moves, and it made a quiet utility's
    level as wide as a volatile name's. The bars themselves already answer
    the question the percentage was guessing at: if the market traded through
    both turning points at the same prices, it was defending the same band.
    A wide, volatile turning point produces a wide zone and a tight one
    produces a tight zone, with nothing to sweep and nothing to ratify.

    `tolerance_pct` is accepted and IGNORED so existing callers that still
    pass it keep working; it is no longer part of the definition.

    **Which side of price (2026-09-14).** `reference_price`, when a finite
    positive live price is supplied, decides support vs resistance. During
    market hours `bars` end at the PREVIOUS session's close (completed bars
    only — `MarketDataProvider.get_ohlcv`), so classifying against that close
    labelled a level "support" after the stock had already traded through
    it (ORCL 2026-09-10: traded 158.38 at the open, desk still called 159.79
    support). The relevance window and strength stay measured from the last
    completed close — they are properties of the completed history.

    Support is below the last close, resistance above it — classified by where
    the level sits *now*, not by whether the pivots forming it were highs or
    lows. A ceiling that price has broken through becomes a floor, and treating
    it as resistance because it was once a swing high would be wrong.

    **Relevance window (2026-09-12).** A repeated turning point only counts
    as actionable structure if the stock can plausibly reach it. "Plausibly
    reach" is not a percentage: it is `horizon_reach` — ``ATR x sqrt(H) x
    MAX_REACH_ATR_MULTIPLE`` — the same estimate `derive_structural_target`
    uses to decide whether a level is a reachable target, evaluated at
    ``H = max_horizon_sessions``, the longest horizon the desk lets any
    trade state. So the window is exactly "the furthest any permitted trade
    could travel": every level the target derivation could ever accept is
    inside it, and a level outside it could be neither a target for any
    stated horizon nor a stop (stops sit ~1.3-1.8 ATR away). It widens on
    a volatile name and narrows on a quiet one because ATR does, with no
    number chosen here. Until 2026-09-12 this was a flat 40% of price,
    which on a 1.2%-ATR utility looked thirty-plus days of travel away and
    on an 8%-ATR name looked five days away — and, once "no floor, no
    trade" became a rule, would have refused good trades on volatile names
    for a level that existed but sat just past an arbitrary line.

    `atr` may be supplied by a caller that already has the instrument's
    ATR(14) (`src/data/technical.py::atr_series` — the one implementation);
    otherwise it is computed here from the same cleaned bars. No ATR means
    reachability cannot be measured, and the scan returns nothing rather
    than fall back to a distance it cannot justify.

# ===========================================================================
# Deriving the TARGET from structure
# ===========================================================================
#
# Why this exists (2026-09-01)
# ----------------------------
# Reward:risk is `(target - entry) / (entry - stop)`. Since 2026-08-27 the
# STOP has been derived in code: structure places it, and
# `min_stop_atr_multiple` pushes it out when structure put it inside ordinary
# volatility. The TARGET was still `TechAnalysisResult.reference_target` — a
# number a language model wrote down. So the gate divided a measured quantity
# by an opinion. Those two are not commensurable, and the failure is
# systematic rather than random: a correctly-sized wide stop plus a modestly
# guessed target fails a 1.5 floor as a matter of arithmetic, whatever the
# trade is actually worth.
#
# Evidence, morning run of 2026-09-01 (`run-64290730`): 38 actionable
# signals, 30 of them (79%) under the floor before any judgement was applied.
# SLB `strong_buy`/`high` scored 1.28 on a 7.7% stop; AGX `sell`/`high`
# scored 0.84. Zero trades were placed.
#
# The floor is not the defect — its numerator is. So the numerator is
# computed here, from the same bars the stop already comes from, and the
# model's guess is demoted from arithmetic input to evidence.
#
# The rule
# --------
# Find the nearest structural level in the trade's direction. FULL STOP —
# the distance to it is not a filter (2026-09-30). It used to be: the level
# had to clear `min_target_atr_multiple` ATRs or it left the candidate set,
# and the target was then taken from the next level out. That contradicted
# the very next clause of this rule, and META's 2026-09-21 add is the
# measured case. `min_target_atr_multiple` now LABELS the answer
# (`TargetDerivation.target_inside_noise`: the whole reward sits inside one
# ordinary session's range) and never chooses it. Then:
#
#   level exists, within reach  ->  the level IS the target. Price has to get
#                                   through the first ceiling before any
#                                   further one, and reaching past it to a
#                                   further level to make the ratio work is
#                                   exactly the invention being removed.
#
#   level exists, beyond reach  ->  nothing structural stands between entry
#                                   and as far as this symbol travels in the
#                                   intended hold, so structure does not
#                                   bound this trade. Target = measured move.
#
#   no level in the direction   ->  nothing overhead is expected to stop this
#                                   trade. Target = measured move.
#                                   (2026-09-11, funnel item 6: this used to
#                                   REFUSE unless `setup_type` separately said
#                                   "breakout". The other reading of an empty
#                                   direction — a chart nothing can be read
#                                   from — is already caught one branch
#                                   earlier as REFUSAL_NO_STRUCTURE, so the
#                                   label was adding nothing but refusals.
#                                   `risk.constants.is_trend_trade` now owns
#                                   this condition, shared with the
#                                   reward:risk exemption.)
#
# "Reach" and the measured move are the same estimate of travel:
# `ATR * sqrt(sessions) * multiple`. Square-root scaling, not linear: daily
# ranges accumulate as a random walk, and `ATR * N` overstates an N-session
# excursion by roughly sqrt(N). `expected_horizon_sessions` is the analyst's
# own estimate of time-to-resolution, already pinned at entry for exactly
# this kind of use.
#
# Note the deliberate asymmetry between the reach multiple and the projection
# multiple. Reach answers "could price plausibly get there at all?", so it is
# loose — a trade that works is by definition an above-typical move. The
# projection answers "how far do I claim it goes when no level says
# otherwise?", so it is the typical excursion and nothing more. The two are
# separately configurable because they are answering different questions.
#
# Everything fails closed. No levels, no level in the direction, no ATR, no
# horizon -> no target and a NAMED reason. There is deliberately no default
# and no fallback: a manufactured target is the defect being removed, and a
# manufactured target with better provenance is still manufactured.
#
# Interaction with `min_stop_atr_multiple` is arithmetic and worth stating
# outright, because it is the binding constraint on the measured-move branch.
# A stop at `k` ATRs and a target at `p * ATR * sqrt(H)` clear a floor `f`
# only when `sqrt(H) >= f * k / p`.
#
# CORRECTED 2026-09-30, board item 90 — the paragraph that stood here was
# wrong on both of its inputs and is not softened. It read "at today's
# settings (p = 1.0, f = 1.5, and k = 1.5 scaled by setup ...) that is
# H >= ~6 sessions". Neither input was still true. `k` has been 2.5 since
# 2026-09-10 (PR #269 moved 3.0 -> 1.5 -> 2.5 in one squashed merge, so
# the 1.5 this line was written against never deployed), and the
# reward:risk floor `f` does not exist at
# all: `min_reward_risk_after_widening` was deleted as dead code on
# 2026-09-24 (board item 81) after it was found never to have refused or
# shrunk a single trade. With no floor there is no `f`, so nothing here
# binds a minimum horizon any more and the session counts quoted below are
# history, not live thresholds.
#
# What IS live, and what replaces the deleted floor as the thing worth
# knowing: on the measured-move branch the target is `1.0 * ATR * sqrt(H)`
# while the unbacked stop is `k * ATR` with no horizon term, so the
# reward:risk ratio of such a trade RISES with the stated hold — about
# 0.98 at H = 6 and 1.79 at H = 20 against the bare 2.5 base, and scaled
# by `_stop_atr_multiple`'s setup and regime factors either side of that.
#
# TWO CAVEATS ON THAT COMPARISON, because an earlier draft of this comment
# overstated it and was corrected the same day. FIRST, the two rules do
# not govern one population: this measured-move target fires when no level
# sits ABOVE entry, while the stop floor fires when no 5-touch level sits
# BELOW it. Those are independent conditions on opposite sides of price,
# so the ratio above describes their INTERSECTION, not either rule's own
# population. SECOND, a stop floor rebuilt as `1.0 * ATR * sqrt(H)` would
# not pin the ratio at exactly 1.0 as that draft claimed — the scalers
# still multiply in, giving roughly 1.17 for range/risk-on and 0.83 for
# breakout/risk-off. What is true, and is the reason to be careful rather
# than to refuse, is that any such floor makes the ratio horizon-INVARIANT
# where today it rises with the hold. The reformulation actually being
# pursued is structural, not another ATR multiple: board item 199.
#
# One further correction in the same place. The line below credited the
# stop floor to "real Maximum Adverse Excursion data". That describes the
# 1.5 that PR #269 passed through, not the live 2.5: the MAE fit was
# dropped both because its window's seat outputs were found to misreport
# confidence and data quality and because fitting a threshold to this
# desk's own past outcomes is barred (docs/OUTCOME.md, the 2026-09-12
# correction). Nor is the live 2.5 "sourced" — see
# `config/number_ledger.yaml` under
# `src.config.RiskConfig.min_stop_atr_multiple`: there is no citation for
# a fixed entry stop at that multiple, and both ends of the quoted band
# are unsupported.
#
# THIS IS THE ARITHMETIC THAT WAS CLOSING THE FUNNEL. Until 2026-09-10 the
# base `k` was 3.0 (range 3.45, breakout 2.55), which put the same thresholds
# at H >= ~21 / ~27 / ~15 sessions. This desk has never stated a 27-session
# horizon, so the range branch — the majority setup — could not clear the
# floor for ANY real signal, and measured against the record it did not: 0 of
# 222. The stop floor was moved off 3.0 in response (see
# `risk.min_stop_atr_multiple` in config/settings.yaml, and the correction
# above about what it was and was not re-derived FROM); these session
# counts fall out of that change, they were not tuned to a target, and per
# the correction above they no longer threshold anything.
#
# The structural-level branch is looser, because the level does not have to
# be a full projection away: it needs `W >= f*k*ATR` to clear the floor and
# `W <= 1.5*ATR*sqrt(H)` to be reachable, so H >= (f*k/1.5)^2 — about 2
# sessions for a range setup (it was ~12).

#: A target closer than this many ATRs is not a destination. Price is
#: already there and the "reward" is one ordinary session's noise.
#:
#: **What it does NOT do, since 2026-09-30: choose the level.** It used to
#: filter the candidate set, so a level inside this distance was dropped and
#: the target promoted to the next level out — past the very structure the
#: instrument had been rejected from. It now only LABELS the outcome
#: (`TargetDerivation.target_inside_noise`), which is the question it was
#: always asking: is the reward worth anything? Where that reward is
#: measured to is a separate fact about the chart, and a wall does not stop
#: being a wall by standing close.

    # built intraday against a live reference price, which is the whole of
    # the difference. $785.20 is what the trade record holds and is the
    # number the desk quoted.) Price stalled at $779.82

    # structure over its 1800-day history and reported it. The selection

#
# FALSIFICATION ONLY. This record exists so the question "what IS a structural
# level — how many bars make a swing point, and how wide is a level's zone?"
# can one day be answered from the desk's OWN record of what its levels did,
# instead of from argument. It may be read to show that the CURRENT definition
# is WRONG: that stops sitting on supposedly-real levels were broken as often
# as stops that sat on nothing, that a zone of a given width held no better
# than a wider or narrower one, that a pivot confirmed by N bars predicted
# nothing.
#
# IT MAY NEVER BE SWEPT FOR A BETTER NUMBER. Choosing `PIVOT_WINDOW` or
# `CLUSTER_TOLERANCE_PCT` by trying candidate values against the outcomes
# stored here is FITTING A NUMBER TO THIS DESK'S OWN HISTORY, which this desk
# bars outright ("no fitting, only reading"). A replacement for either number
# comes from published evidence or from a measurement made on data that is not
# this book's trading record. A pass that lowers a window because the record
# "says so" is the defect, not the finding.
#
# NO INVENTED THRESHOLDS. Nothing here classifies an outcome as "respected",
# "pierced" or "broken", because every one of those words needs a cutoff that
# nobody can source today. Only RAW DISTANCES in price units are stored; the
# classification is derived later, by a reader who states and defends its own
# cutoff, from numbers that were never rounded to it. Anything genuinely
# unknown at write time is stored as JSON null and never substituted.

    RECORDING ONLY — reads the inputs it is handed and computes nothing the
    desk acts on. Nothing in this function decides whether a stop is
    level-backed, how wide a zone is, or where a level sits; it is handed the
    answer the live code already reached and writes down what that answer was
    made of. Read the module note above for the falsification-only limit.

    `level_price` is whatever `PortfolioConstructor._level_backing_stop`
    returned — the computed level the shipping stop sits at, or None when no
    computed level stood behind it. None is a FACT worth recording, not a
    missing value: it is the control group without which "levels hold" cannot
    be falsified, so the record is written either way.

    Fields, all in price units unless stated:
      `level_backed`        — whether a computed level stood behind the stop.
      `level_price`         — that level's price, or null.
      `level_kind`          — "support" for a long, "resistance" for a short,
                              which is the side `_level_backing_stop` searches;
                              null when there is no level.
      `level_touches`       — how many pivots clustered into it, i.e. how many
                              separate times price turned there. Null when the
                              analysis carried no touch count for that price.
      `pivot_window_bars`   — bars required EITHER SIDE of a bar for it to
                              count as a swing point, and `pivot_confirm_bars`
                              the whole confirmation span (window*2+1). This is
                              the "how many bars make a swing point" half of
                              the open question, recorded as it stood at entry.
      `zone_low`/`zone_high`/`zone_width` — the level's own zone, the "how wide
                              is a level's zone" half, as the live
                              `level_zone_halfwidth` drew it at entry.
      `stop_to_level`       — signed distance from the stop to the level price,
                              positive when the stop sits BEYOND the level (further
                              from entry, the protective side) and negative when it
                              sits short of it. Sign is taken per side.
      `stop_inside_zone`    — whether the stop fell inside the level's zone.
      `entry_to_level`      — distance from entry to the level, same sign rule.
      `tolerance_pct`       — the clustering tolerance in force at entry, so a
                              later reader knows which definition produced the
                              level rather than assuming today's.
