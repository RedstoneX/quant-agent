"""Deterministic market context for the Tech Analyst.

Why this exists
---------------
The Tech Analyst was given moving averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger bands, ATR and
a single volume-change percentage, and was expected to behave like a technical
analyst. Most of what a technical analyst actually reasons about was missing:

* whether the name is outperforming its index and its sector — arguably the
  single most-used screen in the profession, and completely absent;
* where price sits in its own multi-year range;
* whether volatility is expanding or contracting relative to its own history;
* whether the moving averages are rising or falling, not merely where they are;
* whether price is coiling in a tight range — which is what actually decides
  whether a setup is a range trade or a breakout;
* how liquid the name is, which bounds how much can be traded;
* momentum across several horizons rather than one recent snapshot.

Every one of those is arithmetic over bars the pipeline already fetches. Like
`src/data/levels.py`, it is computed here rather than inferred by a language
model: it costs microseconds and no tokens, it is identical on every run, and
it can be unit-tested and back-tested. The model's job is to weigh these facts,
not to estimate them from a wall of OHLC rows.

Everything here is a pure function of bars. No network, no configuration, no
side effects.

    Walks backwards from the most recent bar so the nearest gaps are found
    first, and stops once `limit` are collected — older gaps matter less and
    the list is meant to be read, not exhaustive.

    **What makes a gap a gap.** Bulkowski's definition is structural and
    carries no size floor at all: "Gaps occur when today's high is below
    yesterday's low (bearish gap), or today's low is above yesterday's high
    (bullish gap)" (https://thepatternsite.com/gaps.html, fetched
    2026-09-13). The non-overlap test below IS that definition.

    **What makes one worth reporting.** This used to be `_MIN_GAP_PCT = 2.0`,
    inherited convention, justified in prose as "smaller ones are noise that
    ordinary intraday movement fills within hours" (docs/WORK.md item 58).
    A flat percentage says two different things on two different names: 2%
    on a sleepy utility is an event, 2% on a high-beta name is a Tuesday.
    The prose reason is now the test, measured on the instrument: a gap is
    reported when it is wider than one ordinary day's trading range for
    *this* name, which is what ATR measures — so ordinary intraday movement
    demonstrably cannot close it in a session. The published prescription is
    to normalise gap size by ATR rather than by a threshold: "Take the
    distance of the gap and divide it by the ATR of the stock. This will
    give you a sense of the significance of the gap over the ATR lookback
    period."
    (https://www.tradingsetupsreview.com/complete-breakaway-gap-trading-guide/,
    fetched 2026-09-13). The resulting multiple is carried on `Gap.size_atr`
    and rendered, so the analyst sees the significance rather than a raw
    percentage. There is no percentage in this filter any more.

    The ATR used is the one in force at the session BEFORE the gap, so the
    gap bar's own outsized true range cannot raise the bar it has to clear.

    Reported to the analyst as context, and nothing more (docs/WORK.md item
    54, 2026-09-12): for one day a level on the far side of one of these
    gaps was ruled "not a floor". Bulkowski's measurement is the other way
    round — a rising window holds as support only ~20% of the time
    (https://thepatternsite.com/GaugingGaps.html) — so the gap is the weak
    floor and the level beneath it is MORE reachable, not void. No rule
    reads this list any more.

    #    a window: "An NR4 bar is a bar whose high-to-low range is the
    #    narrowest of the most recent four bars; an NR7 is the narrowest of
    #    the most recent seven"
    #    (https://www.luxalgo.com/library/concept/nr4-nr7-narrow-range-bars/,
    #    fetched 2026-09-13), and StockCharts on the same pattern: "Crabel

    #    2026-09-13). The comparison is against the name's own immediately
    #    preceding stretch, so it means the same thing on a utility and on a
    #    high-beta name. It is also Minervini's VCP shape — successive
    #    contractions each smaller than the last — reduced to the one
    #    comparison this detector can make on a fixed window.
    #
    # 2. SIDEWAYS. A narrow range is not sufficient: a slow steady trend
    #    also spans little over a short window. The window's range is spent
    #    either on drift (net move start to end) or on oscillation (the
    #    rest). A base oscillates more than it drifts. That is an identity,
    #    not a tuned cut: `drift <= span - drift` is exactly the old
    #    `_CONSOLIDATION_MAX_DRIFT_RATIO = 0.5`, restated as the break-even
    #    point between drift-dominated and oscillation-dominated rather than

    # sideways trade with a correction of no more than about 15 percent") —

    # past leaders, not laws"
