"""Deterministic market context for the Tech Analyst.

Why this exists
---------------
The Tech Analyst was given moving averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger bands, ATR and
a single volume-change percentage, and was expected to behave like a technical
analyst. Most of what a technical analyst actually reasons about was missing:

* whether the name is outperforming its index and its sector — arguably the
  single most-used screen in the profession, and completely absent;
* where price sits in its own multi-year range;
* whether volatility is expanding or contracting relative to its own history;
* whether the moving averages are rising or falling, not merely where they are;
* whether price is coiling in a tight range — which is what actually decides
  whether a setup is a range trade or a breakout;
* how liquid the name is, which bounds how much can be traded;
* momentum across several horizons rather than one recent snapshot.

Every one of those is arithmetic over bars the pipeline already fetches. Like
`src/data/levels.py`, it is computed here rather than inferred by a language
model: it costs microseconds and no tokens, it is identical on every run, and
it can be unit-tested and back-tested. The model's job is to weigh these facts,
not to estimate them from a wall of OHLC rows.

Everything here is a pure function of bars. No network, no configuration, no
side effects.
