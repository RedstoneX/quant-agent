        the filename, not by lexicographic sort (so 10-K 2026-03-01 beats 10-Q 2026-02-15).

        This is the fallback `_check_symbol` reaches whenever the SEC scan window
        (45 days) has nothing for the symbol — a quiet quarter, not an outage, is
        the common case. Before 2026-09-02 that fallback had no age bound at all:
        whatever was newest on disk was re-served as the CURRENT earnings view no
        matter how old, because `prune()` only removes raw filing HTML, and only
        past 1000 days. A symbol with no new filing for a year would still hand
        back that year-old analysis looking exactly like a fresh one.
        `PortfolioManagerAgent.stale_evidence_sources` already stops a stance past
        this age from EARNING SIZE — but that gate is downstream, in the sizing
        path, and it deliberately leaves a served stance in place (see its
        docstring) rather than remove it, because pulling a stance the PM has
        already cited out of the evidence registry fails `validate_grounding` for
        the WHOLE session, not just that one target. Bounding it HERE instead
        means an over-age analysis is never handed to a session as "current" in
        the first place: the symbol looks exactly like one with no earnings
        coverage yet at all — a CIK miss, an unlisted name, a first-run symbol —
        which every consumer already treats as ordinary, not an error. Nothing
        about `stale_evidence_sources` changes: it still recomputes staleness
        generically from `filing_date` for anything that IS served, so a report
        reaching the PM through some other path is still caught there too.

        Reuses `EARNINGS_STANCE_MAX_AGE_DAYS` (`src/risk/rules.py`) rather than a
        new threshold — this desk already wrote 90 days down twice before this
        fix existed (the earnings seat's own prompt caps conviction past it and
        calls anything past 180d one that "should not have reached you";
        `TradingPipeline._missed_ops_earnings_signal` already refuses anything
        older as "recent" evidence). A fourth, independent number here would just
        be one more way for the three to quietly disagree.

        An unparseable or missing filing_date is treated as too old to serve —
        an unknowable age is not evidence of freshness, the same call
        `stale_evidence_sources` and `_missed_ops_earnings_signal` already make.
