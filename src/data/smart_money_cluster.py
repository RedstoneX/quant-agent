"""Two different things share the word "cluster" here; keep them apart.

1. ``cluster_survivors`` — a ROW-RETENTION rule. Both `SECForm4Provider`
   (SEC Form 4, `stream="insider"`, src/data/smart_money.py) and
   `CongressionalTradingProvider` (Congress disclosures,
   `stream="congressional"`, src/data/congressional_trading.py) reduce their
   candidate observations the same way: keep any single row that alone
   clears a materiality threshold, plus every row of an independent-actor
   group, in either direction, whose members fall within
   ``cluster_window_days`` of some anchor row and whose combined value clears
   that threshold. It decides which rows the seat gets to SEE as context. It
   is not the research-defined cluster and has no effect on conviction.

2. ``insider_purchase_clusters`` — the RESEARCH-DEFINED purchase cluster
   (board item 124, owner ask 2026-09-19): two or more distinct insiders
   making OPPORTUNISTIC open-market purchases (Form 4 code P) in the same
   symbol on the SAME transaction date. This is the fact that may lift the
   seat's conviction (see `src.models._purchase_cluster_lift`).

Sources, as checked 2026-09-19. Alldredge & Blank, "Do Insiders Cluster
Trades with Colleagues? Evidence from Daily Insider Trading", J. Financial
Research 42(2):331-360, 2019 (SSRN 2781761; the SSRN and Wiley pages both
returned HTTP 403 to a fetch, so this rests on the abstract as quoted in
search results): "around 23% of insider purchases occur on the same day as
another insider purchase at the same company", and "clustered insider
purchases are followed by abnormal returns in excess of 2% during the
subsequent month". The abstract's measure is SAME-DAY. A "within two days"
window, "~2.1%" and "0.9 percentage points above solitary purchases" appear
only in a secondary summary (IBKR Campus, "What Corporate Insider Buying Can
Tell Investors"), not in the abstract; they could not be checked against the
paper. Cohen, Malloy & Pomorski, "Decoding Inside Information" (NBER w16454):
opportunistic trades earn "value-weight abnormal returns of 82 basis points
per month" while routine trades' abnormal returns "are essentially zero".

Why the retention rule was NOT changed to same-day/opportunistic: it serves
a different purpose (what context the seat sees, for sells and for Congress
as well as insider buys), and narrowing it would silently drop rows —
routine purchases the seat is told to discount, sells, cross-day groups —
that the seat and the operator currently see. Its two-day window is the
figure from the secondary summary above, not the paper's abstract; it is a
retention parameter, and nothing trade-governing now reads it as the
research cluster.
