"""The intra-check session and the intraday opportunity scan: shims plus the scan body.

Step 8 of `docs/PIPELINE_SPLIT_PLAN.md` (board item 210), clusters R and W, now as
constructed parts. Bodies live in src/intraday/ (`IntradaySession`, `IntradayGating`,
`IntradayCandidates`); `IntradayMixin` keeps same-named thin shims built per call, so
`TradingPipeline` still exposes every one of these as its own attribute and a
collaborator swapped after construction is what the body sees. The one body that
stays HERE is `_intraday_opportunity_scan_body` (399 lines): it is a single function,
so it cannot be carved to fit the 400-line floor for a new file without changing it;
it is still a constructed part (`IntradayScanBody`) with every collaborator handed in.

Names resolved HERE after the first move (plan S5, silent-behaviour risk 1) and
still patched on this module by tests: `compute_indicators`, `agent_log_kwargs`,
`seat_acceptance_kwargs`, `RunContext`, `PaidAnalysisSuspended`, `_persist_evidence`
and `_record_pipeline_event`. The moved bodies resolve their own names in their own
modules.

Nothing here may import `src.pipeline`: this module is one of its bases.

        Runs on the existing intra_check cadence — no new systemd timer,
        no full morning research stack. One cheap bulk current-session
        snapshot call flags symbols that moved materially since the last
        close; those movers (capped, cooldown-deduped against repeat churn)
        PLUS currently held investable names get real daily bars/indicators
        and a real tech_analyst call. Held names join the batch so an
        increase on a quiet hold has current-run Technical and can ground;
        they do not consume the mover cap or the mover cooldown. Then the
        SAME DecisionStage -> RiskStage -> ExecutionStage chain morning
        uses — no separate/duplicated decision logic, so PM's sizing rules,
        RM's veto authority and the deterministic gate all apply exactly
        as they do in the morning run. Bullish AND bearish setups both
        surface: the universe already includes the approved inverse ETFs
        (SH/SDS/PSQ/SQQQ), so a broad-market decline shows up as a
        qualifying move in those symbols the same way a rally shows up in
        a long candidate — no separate bearish code path needed.

        Returns a status dict at every early-exit point — never a bare
        None (2026-08-31 visibility fix; see `_run_intraday_opportunity_scan`
        for the full rationale). "intraday_scan_open_overlap" when morning
        released the owner lock on this same 09:30-shared tick (item 121 —
        still the open, not INTRADAY); "intraday_scan_lock_contended" when
        `_await_paid_scan_slot` cannot free the owner lock before this
        tick's calendar window ends; "intraday_scan_no_opportunity" for
        every other early return (no
        snapshots, no qualifying moves, no ledgerable symbols, no usable
        bars). A tech seat that is fully LOST (every submitted symbol
        failed, or the batch call raised) is NOT folded into that status —
        item 20 (board) — it is classified `data_status["tech"]="failed"`
        and routed through the same evidence-gate skip + unsuppressible
        alert morning uses. Past that point, a real result dict
        mirroring the shape callers of run_morning already expect
        (status/orders/run_id). Best-effort: any failure degrades to a
        status dict, never raises (the caller also wraps this
        defensively) — a scan miss costs a possible trade; a scan crash
        must never cost the loss-protection check that already ran this
        tick.

        The enabled-check and the process-level lock live in the
