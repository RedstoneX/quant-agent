#: THE THREE STATES A SEAT READ CAN BE IN, AND WHY THEY STAY APART.
#:
#: Owner ruling 2026-10-01 makes the desk re-test every holding against the
#: fresh-entry bar several times a day and SELL what fails it. That makes
#: "was this seat read in THIS run?" a question a sell can rest on, and
#: before this it could only be inferred. `carried_forward` is not fresh and
#: `absent` is not stale; conflating either way is the defect.
#:
#: There is NO threshold here and none may be added. `age_seconds` is
#: reported; no number says when an age becomes too old. That number is the
#: owner's and nothing in this module gates on it.
