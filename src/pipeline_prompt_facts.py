"""Prompt-facts builders: read-only DB/broker reads turned into LLM context.

Bodies live in src/prompt_facts/ (eight constructed parts); this mixin keeps same-named
thin shims, built per call so a collaborator swapped after construction is what the body
sees. The module-level names below are re-exported unchanged for importers and patchers
of this module (the ONE mirror block for this module).

Step 1 of `docs/PIPELINE_SPLIT_PLAN.md` (board item 210). Moved verbatim out of
`src/pipeline.py` as a mixin, so `TradingPipeline` keeps every one of these as
its own attribute and every test that patches or calls them is untouched.

The defining property of this module: it places no orders, cancels nothing and
amends no stop. `_handle_ex_dividends` sat in this cluster's line range and does
move live stops, so it is NOT here — it goes to the protection module in step 2
(plan §1 correction, 2026-10-01).

Nothing here may import `src.pipeline`: this module is one of its bases.
