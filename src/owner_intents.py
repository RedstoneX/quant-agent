"""The owner intent record and the flag-only actions Freeze, Stop and Start (panel instalment 1).

Stop (owner ruling 2026-10-09) = the desk is OFF: every job's pickup and every
one-shot entry exits without reads or AI once resting entries are cancelled;
positions and broker-held stops are kept. Start clears Stop and Freeze.

Stored action strings stay PAUSE / RESUME (aliased FREEZE / UNFREEZE) so old
rows replay unchanged; owner-facing outcomes say Freeze / Start.

DESK-SIDE ONLY. `src/api/` must never import this: it writes the database,
and tests/test_api_cannot_trade.py forbids that by construction. A future
raising door must live outside `src/api/`.

State is never stored twice: the flags are a replay of the intents that were
ACTED on, in order. Nothing here moves money or touches the broker; the
broker door reads `current_flags` (see src/execution/owner_flags_gate.py).

Staleness has no time constant. An intent is stale when the owner gave it an
`expires_at` that has passed by the time the desk picks it up (EXPIRED, with
that reason). A row naming an action this desk does not know is REFUSED, with
its reason. Freeze, Stop and Start name no position, so replaying them
in raised order is always correct.

There is no per-position "hands off" and no never-touch list: the desk manages
every position it holds. An owner action is an instruction the desk carries out
and keeps managing, recorded as his decision, never an exemption.
