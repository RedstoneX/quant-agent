"""Make the portfolio manager account for every candidate it was shown.

THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES (board item 118, 2026-09-18)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The seat returned a list of TARGETS and nothing else. `DecisionStage` then
recorded every analysed candidate absent from that list as

    portfolio_manager | omitted | candidate_not_selected_for_target

The seat was never ASKED why it dropped a name. So there was no
per-candidate reason and there could not be one: the ABSENCE of a reason
was the reason, identically, for every name in every session.

That defeats the jam detector (`src/refusal_signature.py`) by
construction. Its whole trigger is "every candidate died for the SAME
reason while the candidates changed" — a jammed gate looks like that, a
quiet market does not, because a quiet market kills different names for
different reasons. With one unvarying code available to it, the two cases
were indistinguishable, and on 2026-09-18 it fired on two sessions and
three candidates (CMCSA; CRM, GME) reporting the only key it could ever
have reported.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT
------------------------------------------------------------------------
It classifies. It decides nothing. No gate, threshold, size, eligibility
rule or trade-governing number reads anything here, and a name's
accounting outcome never changes whether it can be bought — a target is a
target whatever this module says about the names beside it.

The order is the desk's standing heal order (owner 2026-09-16,
`src/seat_heal`), with no step skipped and no new retry invented:

  1. **Mechanical heal, from what the seat DID say.** Two sources, both
     mechanical and neither inventing a reason:
       * a rejection the seat stated for that symbol (shape-coerced by
         `CandidateRejection`, which already tolerates the aliases and
         casings a model reaches for); and
       * a HELD name the seat left out, which the seat's own prompt
         defines as meaning "hold unchanged" — a stated rule read back,
         not a guess. Recorded as its own outcome so it is never confused
         with a refusal.
  2. **One re-ask**, bounded by the SAME one-paid-retry-per-seat-per-
     session cap the research seats and the exit-trigger re-ask already
     use (`seat_heal.can_paid_retry`). No new cap, no loop.
  3. **A durable per-symbol reason** for whatever the seat still will not
     account for: `unaccounted_after_reask`, naming the seat's refusal to
     account rather than pretending to know why the name was dropped.

WHY THE CODE AND THE PROSE GO IN DIFFERENT FIELDS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
`refusal_signature.signature_key` builds its comparable identity from
`stage`, `outcome`, `reason`, the named `refusal`/`fault` code, and
`detail`. The per-candidate prose must NOT reach that key: prose varies
with wording where the cause is identical, so a genuine jam whose
sentences differed would stop being visible as one. The code carries the
identity, in `refusal`, exactly as the deterministic gate's own refusals
do; the reader-facing sentence rides in `note`, which the key does not
read. The owner still sees it — `plain_reason` below is what renders it.

This can only make that alert QUIETER. Before, every candidate produced
one shared key and a session was always monomorphic; now a session is
monomorphic only when every candidate really did die on the same named
ground. The set of keys can only grow, and a streak can only shorten.
