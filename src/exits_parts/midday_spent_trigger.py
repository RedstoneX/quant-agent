"""Spent-trigger gate of the midday exit loop, lifted verbatim out of
`ExitEngineMixin._midday_execute_llm_actions` (src/pipeline_exits.py).

Board item 74: the second-sell-side-action warning and the per-event dedup
that refuses a cut whose trigger and cited record were already acted on
today. The body is unchanged apart from `continue` -> `return SKIP` and
returning the check result `spent` (nothing later in the loop reads it);
`self` is bound to the pipeline instance (`loop.owner`) so every
line reads as before. `acted_today` is the method's own list, so cuts
submitted earlier in the same pass are seen. Sell-side code: behaviour is
identical.
