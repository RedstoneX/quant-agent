"""Holding-discipline fact-check of the midday exit loop, lifted verbatim out
of `ExitEngineMixin._midday_execute_llm_actions` (src/pipeline_exits.py).

Asks whether the trigger an exit names is actually TRUE, through
`exit_guard.holding_discipline_claim_check` as assembled by
`_holding_discipline_check_for_exit`. The body is unchanged apart from
`continue` -> `return SKIP, hd_position_history`; `self` is bound to the
pipeline instance (`loop.owner`) so every line reads as before. The
position-history map is built at most once per pass, so it comes back to
the caller on every return (a refused symbol included) and is handed to the
next symbol, exactly as the loop-local variable was. Sell-side code:
behaviour is identical.

    # position on the strength of the phrasing, with no part of the
    # system ever asking whether a regime shift had happened. The

    # `exit_guard.holding_discipline_claim_check` — but was wired

    # PROVABLY FALSE drops the exit (the morning path's own
    # response, mirroring the existing gates on this loop).

    # the morning path and deliberately: absence of proof is not
    # proof, and refusing an exit on a claim we merely cannot check
    # would trap the desk in a losing position — a far worse
    # failure than the one being fixed. An infrastructure failure
    # inside the check fails OPEN for the same reason, matching
    # `_risk_review_exits`' disclosed posture on this path.
