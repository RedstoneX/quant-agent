        not on submit acceptance.

        ``side`` — 'sell' (default, unchanged) for a long being sold; 'buy'
        for a short being covered. ``position_qty_before_sell`` and every
        qty this function reads back from the broker
        (``_current_position_qty_for_finalize``) are ALWAYS treated as
        non-negative magnitudes here (the broker's own signed qty is
        abs()'d on read) — a short's -73 shares and a long's 73 shares
        drive identical arithmetic; only ``side`` decides which stop side
        gets cancelled/restored/re-placed.

        Submit-acceptance is too early — Alpaca can accept a LIMIT and
        then have it expire / cancel / get rejected later in the session
        without ever filling. If we reprotected on the residual qty at
        accept-time and the SELL doesn't fill, the to-be-sold portion
        rides naked for the rest of the day. PR I (#55) had this gap.

        Reads broker.get_order_fill_info() AFTER wait_for_order_terminal
        has returned, so the fill_qty is final:

        1. ``fill_qty == 0`` (cancelled/expired/rejected after acceptance):
           the position is unchanged but we cancelled the protective
           stops. Restore the original specs covering the full position.
        2. ``0 < fill_qty < position_qty``: protect the actual residual
           ``position_qty_before_sell - fill_qty`` at the most-protective
           cancelled stop_price.
        3. ``fill_qty == position_qty``: full exit, nothing to protect.

        Special case: if get_order_fill_info reports a NON-terminal status
        (the SELL is still 'new' / 'accepted' / 'pending_new' because
        wait_for_order_terminal hit its 15s ceiling without the order
        reaching terminal), finalizing now would race with the broker —
        restoring stops while the SELL is open triggers held_for_orders
        rejection on the new stop submit. Force terminal state by
        cancelling the lingering SELL, then re-read fill_info and
        proceed normally. Codex r5 caught this exact gap.

        Returns ``(success, retry_specs)``:
          - success: True iff coverage is in a known-good state (specs
            were successfully restored / residual was reprotected /
            no residual existed / there were no specs at all). False on
            any bail or restore/reprotect failure.
          - retry_specs: when success=False, the subset of cancelled_specs
            that still need a protection retry. For partial-restore this
            is ONLY the failed specs (the ones that landed are already
            alive at the broker). For other failure modes it's the full
            cancelled_specs list. Empty when success=True.

        ``from_drain=True`` skips the persist-on-bail step (drain
        already has a row). Drain uses retry_specs to NARROW the
        existing row to just what still needs retry — avoids the next
        drain re-submitting a stop that already landed (codex r10 #1).

        No-op when there were no specs to begin with — a position that
        had no protective stop pre-SELL has nothing to restore.

        Used by the bail branches of the finalize core: cancel raised,
        OR cancel was accepted but didn't converge to terminal in 5s, OR
        a restore/reprotect failed. The position is sitting with the
        original stops cancelled and a maybe-still-live SELL — neither
        restoring nor reprotecting is safe right now. Record the intent
        and let the next session's drain pass act once broker state
        settles.

        audit F1: when ``wal_row_id`` is set there is already a
        write-ahead row (inserted BEFORE cancel_protective_stops) — flip
        it to the real order id + final specs via UPDATE instead of
        INSERTing a duplicate. Without a wal_row_id (legacy callers /
        tests) it INSERTs as before. Best-effort — DB failure logs but
        never propagates (the immediate path already had no good
        option).

        ``side`` (Stage 3, shorts) — the closing order's side ('sell' for
        a long, 'buy' for a short's cover), passed through to the
        DB layer either way: on UPDATE it re-affirms the value the
        write-ahead row was created with (belt-and-suspenders — the
        write-ahead insert already set it correctly); on INSERT (the
        legacy-caller / no-prior-row path) it's the only place this row
        will ever get a side recorded.

        persisted ``side`` column (see ``insert_pending_protection_restore``
        / ``_write_ahead_protection_restore``) written at the moment the
        row is created, by whoever is closing the position and therefore
        already knows which side it is. This function is no longer the
        primary source of truth — see ``_resolve_wal_row_side``, which
        prefers the row's own persisted value and calls this ONLY as the
        fallback for a row written before the migration (persisted
        ``side IS NULL``). For those legacy rows this is still the only

        the symbol, fresh (not trusted from whenever the row was written,
        since it can be arbitrarily stale by the time drain gets to it).

        or the other. Returns None both when the position can't be read
        (broker error — the caller must NOT default to 'sell': that's
        exactly the "guess a side" the design review forbids, and for a
        short's row it would try to restore a SELL stop on a position that
        has no shares to back it) and when the position is already flat
        (0) — the caller's downstream restore/reprotect call independently
        re-checks flatness before ever touching a side-dependent broker
        call, so which side an already-flat symbol "would have" used is
        moot, and returning a value here would look like a real answer.
