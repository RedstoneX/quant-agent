"""Coverage election: the row filed for a position whose protective stop has fired but not filled, with the through-stop and notional helpers it reads.

Lifted verbatim out of `ProtectionMixin` (src/pipeline_protection.py) as a
standalone class: every collaborator is an explicit keyword-only
constructor argument, so it is built and exercised without a pipeline.
The mixin keeps a thin method of the same name that builds this object
and calls it, so every existing caller and patch target is unchanged.

    A long's protective stop is a SELL stop and fires as price FALLS

    NO TOLERANCE, no grace band, no minimum distance and no percentage
    lives here, by design: this is a comparison of two numbers the desk
    already holds every session, which is the whole reason this detector
    could be built without inventing a constant. The inequality is STRICT,

    only float-equality case is resolved towards silence rather than
    towards an epsilon nobody chose.

    exposure is reported in DOLLARS, not in shares. A share count is
    meaningless across a book that holds both a $12 name and a $900 one,
    and the whole reason fractional sizing exists here is the $900 one.

    Uses the price already on the broker's position snapshot rather than
    a fresh quote: this runs inside the coverage sweep's per-position
    loop, and an extra round-trip per held name to decorate an alert
    would be paid on every sweep of every session. Returns 0.0 rather

        protective stop orders at the broker. "Open" is the load-bearing
        word — an order the broker has filled is no longer in that list, so
        a stop order that is still listed has not filled. Comparing the
        live price against its trigger therefore answers the whole question:
        price through the trigger + order still open = elected and unfilled.

        backstop.
