        never heard about — closing the 2026-08-28 ONDS/CCJ accounting gap.

        WHAT HAPPENED: ONDS (17 sh @ 8.53, bought 2026-08-27) and CCJ (2 sh
        @ 107.465, bought 2026-08-27) were both closed by their broker-
        resident GTC protective stop-limit order on 2026-08-28 — ONDS at
        7.93 (realized -$10.20), CCJ at 102.955 (realized -$9.02). The
        `positions` table (a derived snapshot of `AlpacaBroker.get_positions`
        via `_sync_positions_from_broker` / `Database.sync_positions`) correctly went to
        zero for both. The `trades` table did not: no SELL/exit row was
        ever written, and the original BUY rows sat forever at
        `realized_pnl IS NULL`. Across the whole ledger, `realized_pnl` was
        set on exactly 4 of 36 trades — every one an exit the system itself
        had submitted (SELL / REDUCE / TRAIL_STOP / SWEEP_SELL all call
        `insert_trade` at submission time, and `_reconcile_fills` /
        `update_trade_fill` fill in `realized_pnl` once the broker confirms
        the fill). A protective stop is different: `place_entry_protection`,
        `_repair_stop_coverage`, and `shift_stops_down` all place a REAL
        order at the broker, but none of them ever write that order into
        `trades` — there was no row for `_reconcile_fills` to find, so a
        stop-out was invisible to the ledger by construction, not by bug in
        the reconciliation LOOP itself.

        Why this matters more than a bookkeeping nit: every exit the ledger
        DOES record is one the system chose; every exit it misses is one
        the market forced. Those are not a random sample of trades — a
        protective stop only fires on a LOSS. Silently dropping stop-outs
        biases every realized-P&L figure upward and starves
        `compute_trade_calibration` / the position reviewer / Phase 7
        measurement of exactly the outcomes most worth learning from.

        HOW THIS DETECTS IT (broker-truth diff, not a stop-order allowlist):
        compare what the ledger BELIEVES it holds per symbol
        (`Database.get_symbols_with_open_ledger_qty` — BUY/SWEEP_BUY minus
        every other executed exit) against what the broker ACTUALLY shows
        (`AlpacaBroker.get_positions`). Whenever the ledger claims more
        shares than the broker has, something closed part or all of that
        position without telling the ledger. For each such symbol, ask the
        broker directly for filled SELL orders since the reconciliation
        lookback window (`ReconciliationConfig.stop_out_lookback_days`) and
        record any whose broker_order_id the ledger has never seen — this
        catches the ORIGINAL entry-protection stop, a coverage-repair
        replacement, an ex-dividend-shifted stop, or any other broker-side
        SELL this process placed but never logged, without needing to
        enumerate every code path that can place one.

        Scoped to LONGS only (a positive ledger/broker qty gap): a short's
        protective stop is a BUY-to-cover, which is deliberately deferred —
        no order path in this repo can open a short's exit position yet
        that this reconciler would need to untangle from a BUY-to-cover
        stop (see shorts-safe's staged rollout). Flagged, not silently
        skipped, if a short ever does show a mismatch (see below).

        Idempotent by construction: `Database.insert_stop_out_trade` keys
        on `broker_order_id` under the same lock as the check, so however
        many of the 5 session entry points (morning / intra_check / midday
        / close / evening) run this, and however many times each does, a
        given stop-out fill is written exactly once.

        FAIL LOUD, NEVER GUESS: when a gap is found but the broker's own
        order history doesn't explain it (query failure, or genuinely no
        matching filled SELL inside the lookback window), this does NOT
        invent a price or silently move on — it logs at ERROR and writes a
        `specialist_evidence` flag an operator can find. Same discipline
        for a recorded stop-out whose `realized_pnl` comes back NULL
        because the ledger's own BUY history can't cover the exited
        quantity (`_realized_pnl_through_trade` already refuses to guess
        there) — the row is still written (never dropped), just flagged.

        Returns a list of `{symbol, ledger_qty, broker_qty, matched,
        recorded}` dicts describing what this pass found, for the caller /
        tests to inspect. Every branch is defensive: a broker or DB failure
        on one symbol is logged and skipped, never aborts the pass for the
        rest of the book.

        """Route dropped reconciler return values to the owner feed.

        Item 101: both `_reconcile_stop_out_fills` (returns a per-symbol list
        of what it wrote back) and `_drain_pending_protection_restores`
        (returns a count of re-protected naked positions) do their write-back
        silently — every call site discarded the return value, so a
        broker-side stop-out reached the owner NOWHERE and a re-protection
        was equally invisible. This is the single surfacing point the call
        sites feed those return values into.

        Does NOT change the reconciliation logic: it only reads what already
        happened and pages the owner through the SAME `send_owner_alert` path
        the unexplained-gap branch already uses (`alert_records_disagree_
        with_broker`). A recorded stop-out is a real forced-loss exit, so per
        the alert-design rule it gets its own standalone message rather than a
        bundled session line.

        Never raises — a surfacing fault must not break the trading path it
        reports on, matching `send_owner_alert`'s own contract.
