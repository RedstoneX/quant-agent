"""src.protection.trim_amend -- the protection half of a trim that shrinks its stop in place.

The broker-touching half (shrink the GTC leg, confirm the replace, settle the
book through the stop quantity invariant) lives in
src/execution/broker_parts/trim_book.py and is reached ONLY through the
injected broker object, so this package imports nothing from src.execution.
What stays here: the owner-facing refusal wording and the finalizer step that
settles the book and discharges the write-ahead (WAL) row.
