"""src.protection.reprotect_records -- the reprotect identity-gap record.

Bodies moved verbatim from src/pipeline_protection.py (`ProtectionMixin`), which keeps
same-named thin shims built per call. Every collaborator is an explicit keyword-only
constructor argument, so this builds and runs with no pipeline behind it. Collaborators
named after a sibling body are the HOST's shim, handed in, never a body this part owns.

        Adversary round 2, defect 4: the reason this path could not prove
        what rests at the broker was a log WARNING and nothing else, so it
        existed only in a rotated file nobody reads per symbol. It is now
        written through `src/risk/exit_refusal.py`, the desk's existing
        append-only per-symbol refusal record, so the next reader of the
        symbol sees why a duplicate may rest or why an intent survived.

        The run id is synthesised from the symbol and the UTC instant
        because this function runs inside broker restore/drain, which
        carries no run context to thread one from; the row is forensic and
        keyed by symbol, not joined to a pipeline run. Never raises: the
        SELL already succeeded and a forensic write must not unwind it.
