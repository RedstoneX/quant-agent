"""src.protection.exit_relief -- exit-settlement registration and the open-exit relief read.

Bodies moved verbatim from src/pipeline_protection.py (`ProtectionMixin`), which keeps
same-named thin shims built per call. Every collaborator is an explicit keyword-only
constructor argument, so this builds and runs with no pipeline behind it. Collaborators
named after a sibling body are the HOST's shim, handed in, never a body this part owns.
Host attributes a body reads with a defaulted getattr or ASSIGNS go through `state`
(a live get/set view the shim hands in), never a copy.

        gap, a halt or a vanished book.

        netting nothing would double the shed.
