    # proven used to wait for a human. On 2026-09-22 that cost the desk the
    # close and evening runs and nine hours of refused analysis on $0.7883 of

    # THE COOLDOWN'S ADMISSIBLE INTERVAL, and why the midpoint:
    #   Upper bound 30 min -- the gap between consecutive paid runs, which
    #     is the intra_check tick, the most frequent paid run there is
    #     [measured: 13-14 paid intra_check sessions a day]. At or above it
    #     a second paid run is lost, which is the damage being fixed.
    #   Lower bound 0 -- there is no run-duration floor. The run that trips
    #     the latch STOPS at the trip (`_trip_locked` suspends its session
    #     and every later `begin_call` raises); the 2026-09-22 tripper ran
    #     1.47 min end to end [measured]. Too short is not unsafe, it just
    #     wastes the day's allowance re-failing against a provider that is
    #     still down.
    # 15.0 is the midpoint of (0, 30): the value furthest from both failure
    # modes, and the one most tolerant of run-start jitter and clock skew in
    # either direction. Two earlier derivations were wrong and are recorded
    # so the number is not re-derived from them: "half the intra tick"
    # (right value, but justified by an aesthetic half) and "bracketed by
    # the longest run at 9.8 min and the 90-min earnings-to-morning gap"

    # cross-process emergency latch that `LLMCostCircuitBreaker.reset()`
    # (operator-only, reason mandatory) is the sole way to clear. Because the
    # cache file is only rewritten when a fetch actually happens, and a fetch
    # only happens once the cache is ALREADY stale, this meant one
    # openrouter.ai outage overlapping the first session after the 24h mark
    # -- verified reproducible 2026-08-28 via
    # test_mandatory_openrouter_refresh_rejects_stale_cache_when_network_is_down
    # -- could stop every future session, including the next day's, until a
    # human ran `reset()` by hand. The desk runs unattended specifically

    # guardrail whose failure mode is "wait for a human" defeats the reason
    # it exists.

    # price nobody has ever fetched: OpenRouter's routed rates change on the
    # order of once a quarter, not hour to hour. So: within this many hours
    # PAST the 24h freshness boundary, a cache that can't be refreshed live
    # is used rather than latched -- widened per
    # `openrouter_pricing_stale_multiplier_max` below and logged loudly on
    # every call -- and only a cache older than 24h + this grace, or no
    # cache at all, or a cache missing a rate for a model actually
    # configured, still fails closed exactly as before. 0 restores the
    # pre-fix behaviour (fail the instant the cache turns stale) for anyone
