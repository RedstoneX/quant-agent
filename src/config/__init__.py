    # 2026-09-30, board item 90 — value UNCHANGED. Reasons live in
    # `config/number_ledger.yaml` under this id rather than copied here;
    # two corrections belong at the definition site itself.
    #
    # FIRST, the "3.0 -> 1.5 -> 2.5 (2026-09-10)" line above is CORRECT and
    # is confirmed here because its counterpart in config/settings.yaml is
    # not: that file says the first leg happened on 2026-09-04, and no such
    # move exists. Read from git, the DEPLOYED value went 3.0 (3dff9408,
    # 2026-08-27) straight to 2.5 (0088328c, 2026-09-10) and was never 1.5
    # — `git log --all -S'min_stop_atr_multiple: 1.5' -- config/settings.yaml`
    # returns nothing. 0088328c squashes PR #269, whose sub-commit one moved
    # 3.0 -> 1.5 and whose sub-commit two moved 1.5 -> 2.5 on the same day;
    # the 1.5 never left that branch. Both legs, one merge, one date.
    #
    # SECOND, "2.5 comes from published swing-trading doctrine" is NOT a
    # citation and this number is not sourced. docs/OUTCOME.md requires a
    # URL a later reader can open. Searched 2026-09-30: no such source
    # exists for a FIXED entry stop, the corroborating 2-3x figures are
    # trailing-stop mechanisms (which the comment below already concedes),
    # and one secondary claim points the other way entirely. Both ends of
    # the quoted band are unsupported, not merely the point inside it.
    # 2.5 is therefore the INTERIM value and is deliberately not re-picked:
    # with no cited band, moving it would be one more unsourced choice.
    # The route that removes this constant for most names it governs is
    # board item 199 (read the floor off the nearest computed level rather
    # than off an ATR multiple).

    # NO `min_reward_risk_after_widening` HERE ANY MORE — removed 2026-09-24
    # (board item 81). It refused nothing and capped nothing: no code in
    # `PortfolioConstructor` ever read `self.min_reward_risk_after_widening`,
    # and the one place the value was threaded to

    # --- Level-backed stops (spec §12.1, 2026-09-01) ---------------------
    # `min_stop_atr_multiple` above used to OVERWRITE the structural stop
    # whenever the level sat closer than the band, after which the stop was
    # at nothing real. On 2026-09-01 the desk reviewed 38 qualified
    # signals and placed zero trades. A stop that sits at a level
    # `src/data/levels.py::find_structural_levels` actually computed is now
    # honoured whatever its ATR distance; the band only applies when nothing
    # computed backs it.
    #
    # NO `level_match_atr_tolerance` HERE ANY MORE — removed 2026-09-13,
    # docs/WORK.md item 46. It was 0.25 ATR and justified itself as being "at
    # least as wide" as the 1% zone `find_structural_levels` clusters pivots
    # into. Those are different units, so the claim was only ever true above
    # a particular volatility: 0.25 x ATR >= 0.01 x price needs ATR >= 4% of
    # price. At the 2.56%-of-price median ATR this repo's own comments quote,
    # 0.25 ATR is 0.64% — 1.56x NARROWER than the zone it claimed to cover,
    # so a stop sitting inside a level's real zone was not counted as sitting
    # at that level. There is no honest ATR multiple to replace it with: the
    # zone is defined as a percentage of price, the tolerance was a multiple
    # of ATR, and the ratio between them changes with every name on every
    # day. It is not replaced by a different constant — it is deleted, and
    # "is this stop AT this level" now reads the zone's own bound from
    # `src.data.levels.level_zone_halfwidth`, which derives it from the same
    # `CLUSTER_TOLERANCE_PCT` that built the zone. The two can no longer
    # disagree because there is only one of them.
    #
    # The ATR argument the old comment made is not lost, it was misplaced:
    # "is this stop far enough out to survive the name's noise" IS an ATR
    # question, and it is already asked, deterministically, by
    # `min_stop_atr_multiple` and `absolute_min_stop_atr_multiple` below.
    # "Which level is this stop sitting on" is an identity question about a
    # zone, and is answered in the zone's own unit.
    # The deterministic backstop under the exemption above. §12.1's safety
    # argument rests on the 1*ATR hard floor in
    # `config/prompts/tech_analyst.md` — but that is a PROMPT, and Invariant
    # 2 requires deterministic Python protections to be the final authority
    # and to fail closed. A real support level 0.2 ATR under entry is genuine
    # structure AND a guaranteed whipsaw. So a level-backed stop is honoured
    # however tight down to this many ATRs; inside it the stop is pushed out
    # to exactly this floor — never to the full `min_stop_atr_multiple` band.

    # already requires 2 touches to register a level at all (`MIN_TOUCHES`),
    # but §12.1's own text names that as a SEPARATE, undecided question: "a
    # level currently qualifies on two touches ever ... so two old swing
    # points can justify a very tight stop." The measured table (101
    # symbols, 5 years, daily bars, real vs shuffled arithmetic control)
    # only clears real-vs-shuffled separation cleanly at 5+ touches: real
    # 0.644 [0.590, 0.696] against shuffled 0.505 [0.470, 0.539] — the
    # confidence intervals do not overlap at all. Every lower bucket's
    # intervals overlap or nearly touch (2 touches: real floor 0.510 versus
    # shuffled ceiling 0.510; 3 and 4 touches overlap outright), so a bar
    # below 5 would be honouring a tight stop on a separation that could be
    # noise. Below this bar the stop is NOT treated as level-backed and
    # falls back to `min_stop_atr_multiple` / `absolute_min_stop_atr_multiple`

        The cost circuit stops a logical call once it exceeds
        `llm_cost_circuit.max_provider_attempts_per_call` provider attempts.
        `BaseAgent.run()` decides how many attempts actually happen. When the
        ceiling is below what the loop can spend, the circuit fires on the
        loop's normal, designed behaviour rather than on anything unsafe — and
        because that stop is scoped to the session, a routine upstream
        rate-limit costs the desk a trading session for pennies of spend.

        That is not hypothetical: it is the 2026-08-31 09:32 ET incident
        recorded on `provider_attempt_budget`, where a hand-pinned 2 sat
        against a worst case of 3 and made cross-provider failover impossible
        to ever complete.

        The two numbers live in different worlds — one an env-overridable
        module constant, the other a YAML setting — which is exactly how they
        drifted apart unnoticed for six days across five separate trips. So
        the agreement is enforced here, at load, rather than trusted to
        whoever edits either one next. Failing to boot is the loud failure;
        going dark two minutes after the opening bell is the quiet one.

        `failover_available` is derived from the SAME not-identical-pair rule
        `BaseAgent._failover_reachable` uses at runtime (via
        `_fallback_reachable_for_any_agent`/`_fallback_key_for_provider`
        above) rather than independently keying off `api_keys.anthropic` —
        that independent keying is exactly what let this check and the
