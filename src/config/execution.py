    ON in `config/settings.yaml` since 2026-09-18. The field default stays
    FALSE deliberately: a config that does not mention the socket, and
    every test double that constructs this model bare, must not open one.
    `AlpacaBroker._fill_stream_enabled` defaults false for the same reason.

    The socket pushes a fill the instant it happens; with it off the desk
    only learns of a fill on its next REST poll, which
    on the bounded polling path can be up to half an hour later. The REST
    path is untouched and remains the fallback for any wait the socket
    cannot serve.

    It was OFF from 2026-09-17 because the socket had never once
    authenticated — 1,017 `failed to authenticate` occurrences across the
    retained production logs and zero successes. The cause was not the
    connection's timing (six pull requests adjusted that; none of them
    could have worked). The process held a 29-character PLACEHOLDER
    credential containing the literal word `placeholder`, and neither of
    the two mechanisms that could have substituted a real one applies to
    this socket:

      1. Alpaca authenticates the stream with an in-band websocket
         MESSAGE, not a handshake header, while the local gateway that
         substitutes the real key rewrites HTTP HEADERS — so it cannot
         reach the credential at all.
      2. The installed `alpaca-py` stream is built on `websockets.legacy`,
         which has no proxy support (that arrived in websockets 15.0, and
         only in the asyncio and sync clients), so the socket never
         traversed the gateway either.

    Real credential files were delivered 2026-09-18 and the process now
    reads them directly, so that single blocker is gone and this flag was
    the only remaining thing holding the socket shut. This flip changes no
    timeout, poll interval, retry count or ceiling, and nothing about
    credential handling.

    A refusal is now diagnosable rather than silent: the SDK throws the
    rejection payload away and raises a bare `ValueError`, which the desk
    used to log as `status=unknown` — indistinguishable from a transport
    fault, and the reason this took a fortnight to identify.
    `_install_trading_stream_auth_diagnostics` preserves Alpaca's own
    `message`/`status` and logs
    `trade_updates authentication REJECTED by broker`, with the key's
    length and first two characters only — never the value, never the
    secret. A successful handshake logs
    `trade_updates websocket authenticated`.

    CEILINGS ADDED 2026-09-18 (after the storm audit). Enabling this flag
    no longer risks an unbounded reconnect loop. The installed alpaca-py
    retries a failed handshake every 10ms with no backoff and no limit of
    its own — that is what produced 32,896 attempts and 32,666 HTTP 429
    rejections on 2026-09-15 — so `src/execution/broker.py` now enforces
    both a per-session and a per-day attempt ceiling of its own, treats a
    429 as a rate-limit stand-down rather than a transport retry, and when
    a ceiling is reached stops the socket for the day, tells the owner once
    in plain words, and leaves fills to the bounded REST path. See the
    `_STREAM_ATTEMPT_CEILING_*` constants there for each number's source."""
