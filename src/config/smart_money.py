    #   0.156 s per filing read, measured over 40 reads at the 8 req/s
    #   limiter below (SEC's published maximum is 10 req/s:
    #   https://www.sec.gov/os/accessing-edgar-data).
    #   11.0 + 5,431 x 0.156 = 858.2 s -> 859.

    # 7 -> 90 -> 365 on 2026-09-11. This bounds how far back an insider/SEC
    # observation is FETCHED and RETAINED at full detail — a trade older
    # than this is invisible to correlation entirely, not just discounted.
    #
    # 365 days is a real BEHAVIORAL bound, not a calendar guess: per the
    # owner directly, someone acting on genuine inside information has no
    # logical reason to sit on it for more than a year before trading —
    # if they haven't acted within a year, the information itself either
    # played out already or was never that actionable. That's what sets
    # this number, not a storage/network cost tradeoff.
    #
    # (7 days matched nothing real to begin with: Seyhun (1986) found only
    # ~1/4 of an insider purchase's eventual abnormal return realizes in
    # the first 5 days and ~1/2 is still unrealized after a full month;
    # real M&A run-ups start MONTHS before the announcement. 90 was an
    # intermediate step, matching `EARNINGS_STANCE_MAX_AGE_DAYS`.)
    #
    # Neither real infra cost binds at 365: NETWORK cost is already
    # bounded elsewhere — `refresh()` is accession-keyed and resumable, a
    # filing already processed is never re-fetched, so this number only
    # sets how many PAST DAYS get a "anything new here?" search query each
    # refresh, with headroom left in this file's own rate/deadline budget.
    #
    # RE-CHECKED 2026-09-18, and the paragraph above was TEMPORARILY FALSE
    # for one day. It rests on the claim that only `refresh()` walks the
    # window — once a day, pre-market. `peek_accessions` was added
    # 2026-09-17 and called the same day-by-day discovery from inside every
    # intraday decision tick, so the cost this number was cleared against
    # was being paid ~13 times a day inside the decision path, where it ran
    # the tick out of its deadline. The derivation is sound again because
    # the intraday freshness check no longer walks the window at all: it
    # reads each watched issuer's own filing history
    # (`SECForm4Provider.form4_freshness`), which is O(watched names) and
    # independent of this number. Anything added later that walks the
    # lookback window from inside a decision tick falsifies this paragraph
    # again — that is the thing to check, not the value.
    #
    # RE-CHECKED 2026-09-19: "a filing already processed is never
    # re-fetched" still holds, but the claim that this number only sets how
    # many search queries run does NOT. Since PR #529 the watched-name drain
    # must READ every unread Form 4 inside this window on every watched
    # issuer before that issuer's evidence can be called current. Raising
    # 7 -> 365 therefore created a one-time read of 5,431 filings on the
    # desk's 82 watched issuers (measured 2026-09-19), which the drain
    # could not do inside the 180 s it shared with the market-wide pass.
    # That cost now has its own budget, `watched_drain_deadline_s`, sized
    # from the measurement. The value 365 is unchanged — it is the owner's
    # behavioural bound, and draining it is cheaper than seeding a claim
    # of coverage the desk has not read.
    # STORAGE cost is small: measured directly against the live server's
    # actual cache 2026-09-11 — 4,324 records / 5.76 MB at the old 7-day
    # window, roughly ~300 MB at 365 days on a straight scale-up — trivial
    # for a server either way.
    #
    # This is a FETCH/RETENTION bound, not a support-eligibility gate —
    # whether an old observation can actually support a target is decided
    # by correlation with other current evidence (see
    # `PortfolioManagerAgent`'s grounding validator), not by this number.

    # How recent a congressional disclosure must be to stay in `fetch()`'s

    # is sized for SEC Form 4's ~2-business-day filing deadline, and applying
    # it to a stream that can legally lag 45 days would silently discard
    # nearly every real disclosure. Do NOT "harmonise" the two — they measure
    # two different statutory regimes and the Form 4 one is intentionally
    # tighter.
    #
    # Why 180 and not the 30 this shipped with:
    #   * The STOCK Act deadline is "no later than 45 days after the
    #     transaction" (House Ethics / Senate Select Committee on Ethics PTR
    #     instructions, re-verified 2026-09-04) — so a 30-day window cannot
    #     even cover the LEGAL lag, let alone real behaviour.
    #   * Filers in practice file at or near the deadline, and late filings
    #     (past 45 days) are common and still legitimate, recent trades.
    #   * Corroborating real-world datapoint: the author of a comparable free
    #     congressional-trading tool documented choosing a 180-day default for
    #     exactly this reason — a short window silently returned almost
    #     nothing. 180 is that observed-in-the-wild figure, not one invented
    #     here.
    # This is a data-COVERAGE window, not a signal-strength one. Corrected
    # 2026-09-19: this comment used to say `SmartMoneyFinding.
    # deterministic_eligibility` (src/models.py) requires congressional-only

    # or more members, one direction, each filed within the STOCK Act's 45
