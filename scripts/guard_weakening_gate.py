"""Refuse a change that edits a guard unless a commit justifies it.

Why: a change was nearly merged that loosened the file-size ratchet so two
blocked changes would go green; the loosened rule was gameable (delete a
300-line test file, grow a monolith by 299 lines). Nothing in CI objected.

WHICH FILES ARE GUARDS (derived, never listed -- a list rots)
    scripts/*guard*.py          any script whose name says guard
    tests/test_*guard*.py       any test whose name says guard
    tests/test_*ratchet*.py     any test whose name says ratchet
A new guard that follows the naming rule is covered the day it is added.

WHAT A GUARD IS, BY IDENTITY (measured, 2026-10-05, scripts/*.py on trunk)
    A script that REFUSES (raises SystemExit / calls sys.exit) AND INSPECTS the
    repository or trunk (a git call, origin/main, a tree walk, an AST parse).
    Of 78 scripts, 39 behave that way; the name rule covered only 17 of them.
    That identity set is REPORTED on every run, and with ENFORCE_BEHAVIOURAL
    switched on it is also demanded. It is OFF today on purpose: open changes
    edit 8 of the 22 uncovered scripts, and demanding a trailer of them would
    turn every one red at once. Tests are not widened (see coverage()).

WHAT IS CAUGHT
    Any edit or deletion of an existing guard file whose behaviour could have
    changed. Tightening cannot be told from loosening reliably (a threshold's
    direction depends on the guard), so the rule is deliberately over-asking:
    EVERY behavioural edit needs the justification. The only exemptions are
    provable no-ops: a new guard file (it only adds refusals), and a .py edit
    whose AST is identical once docstrings are stripped (comments, blank lines
    and formatting never reach the AST).

WHAT ELSE IS COVERED (limits and exceptions, by pattern)
    config/check_allowlists/*.txt   any edit that ADDS a line (blank lines and
                                    # comments do not count). Pure deletions
                                    shrink an allow-list and need nothing.
    pyproject.toml                  any added line inside a [tool.ruff...]
                                    table: per-file-ignores, limits, selects.
                                    Removed lines need nothing.
Pattern-based, so a new allow-list file is covered the day it lands.

THE JUSTIFICATION
    A commit message line, ONE PHYSICAL LINE, starting `Guard-rule-change:`
    of at least 25 words that (a) names the mechanism making the existing rule
    incorrect and (b) states why the new rule cannot be gamed. Word count is
    mechanical; (a)/(b) are for the reviewer and the adversary.

STORES NOTHING. Computed against origin/main at check time; when the base
cannot be read the gate FAILS -- inability to compare is never a pass.
