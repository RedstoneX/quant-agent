"""Daily desk reset — flatten the paper book and clear contaminated history.

The owner resets the desk every day until the trade logic stabilises. That
makes this a tool, not a remembered incantation: it is dry-run by default,
it refuses to touch a live account, it backs up before it deletes, and it
prints a before/after summary you can paste into a log.

    # See exactly what would happen (default — touches nothing):
    ./scripts/desk_reset.py

    # Do it:
    ./scripts/desk_reset.py --execute

WHAT IT DOES
    1. Proves the account is a PAPER account (four independent checks,
       see `assert_paper_account`). Any doubt aborts.
    2. Refuses to run while the market is open, or while one of the desk's
       own session windows is live (`--allow-market-open` /
       `--allow-session-window` to override, deliberately separate flags).
    3. Backs up the SQLite database and a JSON snapshot of the broker book
       to a timestamped directory. Non-negotiable; there is no --no-backup.
    4. Flattens the book: cancels every open order, liquidates every
       position (Alpaca's DELETE /v2/positions?cancel_orders=true).
    5. Clears the contaminated trading history from an explicit table
       ALLOWLIST. Never drops tables, never touches files, never touches
       anything under git, docs/, or the incident history.

WHAT IT NEVER TOUCHES
    Price/pricing caches, company profiles, news/macro/earnings/technical
    stores, checkpoints, the OpenRouter pricing cache — all of it is on
    disk, expensive to rebuild, and this tool does not delete files at all.
    It only DELETEs rows from the tables named in `TABLE_POLICY`.

    The LLM cost ledger (`agent_logs`) and the cost-circuit tables are KEPT:
    they are spend accounting, not trading decisions, and `src/token_budget.py`
    fits its per-model size estimates from `agent_logs` (MIN_SAMPLES = 8).
    Wiping them would reset the desk's spend record and its budget fits.

MARKET-HOURS TRADE-OFF (read this once)
    Alpaca queues non-extended-hours orders submitted after 16:00 ET for
    release the next trading day
    (https://docs.alpaca.markets/us/docs/orders-at-alpaca). Liquidation via
    DELETE /v2/positions is a market order, so:

      - Reset with the market CLOSED  -> the book is *scheduled* flat, not
        flat. The sells fill at the next open, i.e. right on top of the
        09:30 morning session.
      - Reset with the market OPEN    -> the fills are immediate and real,
        but the desk's own timers are live and `intra_check` covers the
        whole 09:30-16:00 session, so something can trade against you
        mid-reset.

    There is no window that is both "market open" and "no desk session
    window active". The safe procedure is therefore: stop the desk's
    timers, reset during regular hours with --allow-market-open, confirm
    flat, restart the timers. Running it after the close is supported and
    is the default-legal path, but you must keep the morning timer masked
    until the queued sells have filled. The tool prints this each run.
