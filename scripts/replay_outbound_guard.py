"""Board item 202: every place ``src/`` can reach a provider is a NAMED replay seam.

A replay of a recorded session must be deterministic and free. The runtime wall
(``ops/rehearsal/network_wall.py``) catches an outbound attempt when it happens;
this guard catches it when it is WRITTEN. Any source file that imports an HTTP,
socket or provider-SDK client is an outbound site, and a NEW site — a new file,
or a new client module inside an existing file — must first be handled in the
rehearsal: served from a recording by the patch-where-the-client-is-built
pattern, or refused loudly naming the missing recording (see
``ops/rehearsal/feed_recording.py``, ``market_recording.py``).

FIXED EXCEPTION LIST, PER IMPORT
--------------------------------
Every existing outbound import is named in
``config/check_allowlists/struct_replay_outbound.txt`` as ``file | client``: one
line per (file, client module) pair, never per module and never a count. The
check scans the working tree and compares nothing with any trunk. It fails on a
(file, client) pair not in the list (a new file, or a new client in an old file)
and on a listed pair that no longer occurs (stale entry).

``CLIENT_MODULES`` below is the one thing that IS policy — the list of module
names that mean "this code can leave the box" — and it stays in code, where it
is reviewed. It is a definition, not a record of the current state.

Run it directly: ``python -m scripts.replay_outbound_guard``.
