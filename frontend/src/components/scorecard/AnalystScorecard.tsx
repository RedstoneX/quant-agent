/* The analyst scorecard — Mission Control's read of the conviction ledger
 * (docs/QAMC_REMEDIATION_SPEC.md §9.5).
 *
 * Four sections, in the order a reader needs them: the desk at a glance, the
 * ranked table, one analyst opened, one idea traced.
 *
 * PLAIN LANGUAGE IS A REQUIREMENT HERE, NOT POLISH. The reader is not a
 * developer or a trader. Every term is explained on this page before it is
 * used, money is money, and the words "R", "R-multiple", "seat", "payoff
 * ratio", "expectancy", "drawdown" and "conviction-weighted" appear nowhere in
 * what renders. The backend speaks in R; this page converts every figure to
 * the worked-example dollars the explainer defines and never shows the unit.
 *
 * ACCESSIBILITY IS BINDING. The owner has red-green colour blindness. In every
 * graphic on this page the meaning is carried by position against a drawn zero
 * line, an explicit + or − sign, a ▲/▼ glyph, or solid-versus-outlined shape.
 * Colour only ever repeats something one of those already said, and a red and
 * a green element are never placed next to each other as the sole distinction
 * between them.
