// Scroll policy lives with the PANEL, not with the slot it happens to
// occupy (owner correction 2026-09-17: every panel here is draggable, so
// "the bottom two" stops being true the moment he rearranges anything).
//
// Panels listed here are sized BY THEIR CONTENT: no internal vertical
// scrollbar, the row they sit in grows to fit them, and the page scrolls
// instead — which is exactly what the owner asked for ("can't you just
// make the page bigger and get rid of the scroll bars"). Drag one of
// these to the top of the workspace and it keeps behaving this way.
//
// Everything NOT listed keeps a normal internal scrollbar. Holdings and
// Positions are deliberately absent: they are lists that keep growing as
// he holds more names, and he said explicitly that their scrollbars are
// fine and easy to read. Chart is absent for a different reason — it is
// a canvas that fills whatever box it is given and has no natural
// content height to fit to.
//
// A THIRD policy joined those two on 2026-09-18 (owner request,
// board item 103): "both". Vertical and horizontal scrollbars, internal
// to that one panel. It exists because Trades is not shaped like the
// other tables — it carries sixteen columns (time, symbol, action, a
// full reasoning paragraph, fill status, filled qty, fill price,
// realized P&L, recorded stop, take profit, run, decision, conviction,
// requested risk, allocated risk, decision model). Fitting all of that
// to the panel's width crushed every column to a few characters, and
// fitting it to its HEIGHT grew the page to roughly six thousand pixels.
// Scrolled in both directions, the columns render at their natural
// widths and the row stays inside the panel.
//
// Expressed as a per-panel policy, not a check for the name "trades",
// so moving Trades anywhere in the workspace takes its scrolling with
// it and any future panel can opt in by naming its policy here.

//
// Bumped v7 -> v8 (owner lock): Holdings leaves the fixed header and
// becomes a Dockview panel above the chart — movable, dockable, resizable
// like Positions/Orders. The chart-vs-bottoms sash is two-way (borrow from
// the row above or the row below, then grow the page only after the
// bottoms floor). v7 blobs would keep Holdings out of the workspace.
//
// Bumped v6 -> v7 (hierarchy pass): default bottoms height drops from
// the 340 "header + 5 rows" start to the 260 floor so the chart row is
// the largest region on first load / Reset layout. v6 blobs would
// otherwise keep the shorter chart. Reset layout still restores this
// shape; the sash and rearrange behavior are unchanged.
//
// Bumped v5 -> v6 (owner request, direct): the bottom row's middle
// "Workspace" slot — genuinely empty by default, see WorkspaceSlotPane
// above — was eating roughly a third of the bottom row's width while
// showing nothing. The owner asked for a plain two-column bottom row
// instead (Positions | Orders, split evenly) so those two panels get that
// width back; buildDefaultLayout no longer adds a workspaceSlot panel at
// all. As with every previous bump, a v5 layout persisted from
// localStorage is not being migrated or read under this key — it simply
// stops being looked up, which is the point: without bumping the key,
// every browser that already has a saved v5 layout (three columns, empty
// middle) would keep opening to that shape and never see the new
// two-column default. WorkspaceSlotPane's component registration is kept
// regardless (see its comment above) purely so a layout blob that does
// reference "workspaceSlot" can still be restored via fromJSON without
// throwing on an unknown component id.
//
// Bumped v4 -> v5 (cockpit pass 3, item 2): the default workspace shape
// changed from one row of three columns (Positions | Chart | Orders) to
// two rows — a full-width Chart row on top, then a Positions/free/Orders
// three-column row below (see buildDefaultLayout). A v4 layout persisted
// from localStorage is still a perfectly valid dockview shape (nothing
// referenced by it was removed), so this bump exists purely to change
// what EVERY BROWSER sees as the default on first load / after "Reset
// layout" — without it, anyone who already has a saved v4 layout would
// keep seeing the old one-row shape and never notice the new default
// exists. Existing saved layouts are otherwise untouched: dockview state
// is genuinely additive/positional, not a fixed schema, so a v4 blob
// would have loaded fine under this key too. (v3 -> v4 / v2 -> v3
// history: the Decision Room panel was removed entirely — its content
// lives in Lifecycle (summarizeDecision) and the Research Desk
// DecisionDeltaPanel; Positions
// moved from a background tab inside the chart group to its own leftmost,
// active-by-default group; Liquidity left the workspace entirely for a
// compact header row — item 9; System+Search merged into one Diagnostics
// panel — item 13.)

  // below, same as every other panel arrangement in this workspace.
  //
  // Fix (owner bug report, 2026-09-10, round 3): the sash above had NO
  // floor at all — dragging the chart bigger could crush this row to
  // ~90px, just the Panel title bar with a single data row requiring the
  // panel's own internal scrollbar to see a second one. minimumHeight is
  // dockview's own native per-panel constraint (Constraints in
  // gridview/gridviewPanel.d.ts, accepted directly by api.addPanel — see
  // AddPanelOptions & Partial<Constraints> in dockview/options.d.ts), so
  // the sash itself simply stops/clamps at the floor rather than fighting
  // a separate CSS min-height against dockview's own layout math.
  // Calculated, not guessed, from DataTable.tsx's own Tailwind classes:
  // each row (header or data) is `px-2 py-2` (16px padding) on `text-sm`
  // (20px line-height) = 36px/row, exact. Non-table chrome stacked above
  // that inside this same row: dockview's own tab strip
  // (--dv-tabs-and-actions-container-height: 34px, styles/index.css,
  // exact) + Panel.tsx's `.panel-head` title/subtitle bar (~57px,
  // estimated from its own py-2.5 padding + two wrapped text lines, not
  // measured live) + `.panel-body`'s `py-3` padding (24px, exact) = ~115px
  // fixed overhead. 115 + 36 * 4 (header + 3 full data rows) = 259,
  // rounded to 260 — enough that the row can never be dragged below
  // showing the table header plus a genuine 3 data rows, which is what
  // was actually missing (today's 230 default lands closer to header +
  // 2 rows once this same chrome is accounted for, which is why the bug
  // was reachable at all). This does mean the resting default nudges up
  // slightly from 230 to 260 on any layout that was sitting below the new
  // floor — the tradeoff for a floor that's actually enough to read a
  // second/third position without scrolling.
  // Owner override 2026-09-11 (vertical-space reallocation pass): the
  // owner reversed the 2026-09-10 "sacrifice positions/orders for a
  // bigger chart" trade — that 230 default sat BELOW the 260
  // minimumHeight floor computed above (dockview clamps it up to the
  // floor on layout, so 230 never actually rendered), and the floor
  // itself only fit header+3 rows with no room for the 20px bottom
  // padding added in an earlier fix that same day. Raised to 340 — floor
  // math (115px fixed chrome + 36px/row) puts that at header + 5 full
  // rows + the 20px padding with room to spare, so the panel starts
  // comfortably past "3+ rows" rather than exactly at it. This is a

// Owner bug report, 2026-09-11 ("dragging the chart bigger just stops
// working"): the workspace box below used to have a DEFINITE, fixed
// total height (the calc() in WORKSPACE_DEFAULT_HEIGHT). Dockview-react
// fills whatever box it's given — it watches its own container with an
// internal ResizeObserver and re-lays-out to fill it (dockview-core's
// `disableAutoResizing` option, default off); it has no mechanism to grow
// that container itself, only to redistribute the space already inside
// it. So once the Positions/Orders row hit its minimumHeight floor (see
// buildDefaultLayout above), the chart/positions sash had nowhere left to
// take space FROM — the drag kept firing mouse events but dockview
// silently had nothing to give, so it looked like the drag "stopped
// working" past that point.
//
// First fix attempt (didn't work, root cause found 2026-09-11 round 3):
// watched dockview's sash for `.dv-minimum` and grew the box while that
// class was present. Traced live against dockview-core's actual
// `updateSashEnablement()` (splitview implementation): for a two-view
// vertical split, the class applied when the LOWER view (Positions/
// Orders) is pinned at its own minimumSize and the upper view (chart)
// still has room is `.dv-maximum`, not `.dv-minimum` — `.dv-minimum` is
// the class for the opposite edge (chart pinned at ITS floor). The
// listener was watching a class that is never set in this drag
// direction, so `atFolor` was permanently false and growth never fired.
// That's a real dockview-core behavior (verified by reading
// `updateSashEnablement` in dockview-core's built output, not assumed),
// but relying on it also means silently re-deriving dockview's internal
// multi-view collapse/expand algorithm for every layout shape a user can
// rearrange into — fragile even with the correct class name.
//
// Fix (this pass): drop class-watching entirely. Track the mouse
// directly during a sash drag and compute the needed growth purely from
// cursor position — see the mousedown/mousemove handlers below. This
// sidesteps dockview's internal clamp state altogether: growth is a pure
// function of "how far past the natural (ungrown) floor-line has the
// mouse gone," independent of whatever class dockview-core happens to
// apply this version or that layout shape.
//
// The box rests at exactly WORKSPACE_DEFAULT_HEIGHT. Positions/Orders'
// own minimumHeight (260, set in buildDefaultLayout) still does the
// actual floor-holding inside dockview; this code only ever ADDS height
// on top of the resting default, never removes any, so it cannot itself
// crush anything below that floor. The visible effect: past the old
// ceiling, the box keeps growing 1:1 with the drag instead of clamping,
// which pushes the footer down and requires page scroll — the explicit
// trade the owner asked for.
//
// Round-4 fix (owner bug report, 2026-09-11, "the direct sash stopped
// responding"): the trigger line below used to be computed as
// wrapper-bottom minus a single hard-coded 260px constant (one
// Positions/Orders row's floor). That only holds for the DEFAULT
// side-by-side layout — the moment Positions/Orders end up STACKED (two
// floors, ~520px reserved, not 260px), the line sat ~260px below the
// sash's real, already-maxed position, so a drag starting right at the
// visible sash needed ~260px of dead motion before growth ever kicked
// in — reading exactly as "the sash doesn't respond," while a drag that
// wandered far enough down (past Positions, into/under Orders) crossed
// the erroneous line anyway and did grow the chart. Fixed in the
// mousedown handler below by reading the sash's own live position
// instead of assuming a fixed reserved-floor constant.

      {/* Item 2 of cockpit pass 3 (SUPERSEDED AGAIN, owner override
          2026-09-10, round 2): the resize-y box above (a manual CSS
          `resize: vertical` corner grip) was itself the regression this
          replaces — confirmed live: "difficult to find, tiny corner grip,
          not a proper draggable divider," and its height formula
          (max(560px, 100vh-chrome) + a flat 480px for Positions/Orders)
          ALWAYS exceeded the viewport by construction, forcing the whole
          page to scroll just to reach the workspace, let alone resize it.
          Two changes, together:
          1. The resize-y/overflow-auto/max-h corner-grip hack is gone
             entirely. The chart-vs-Positions/Orders split is now handled
             by dockview's OWN native sibling-panel resize sash (see
             buildDefaultLayout's "positions" panel above,
             direction: "below") — a proper draggable divider with a
             resize cursor and an accent highlight on hover
             (--dv-sash-color/--dv-active-sash-color, styles/index.css),
             not a hand-rolled mechanism. This is strictly more robust
             than continuing to patch the manual approach, and it's what
             the library already does for free between real sibling rows.
          2. The box's total height is viewport-bounded
             (100vh - var(--chrome-h), the same --chrome-h budget
             TopStrip..DecisionStateBanner above already measures live —
             see App.tsx's chromeRef) so the box's own bottom edge lines
             up with the browser window's bottom edge instead of
             guaranteed-overflowing it, with a min-h floor (640px) so a
             day with an unusually tall chrome stack still leaves enough
             room for both a genuinely readable chart and a usable
             Positions/Orders row rather than crushing both to nothing —
             on a short viewport this floor can still require some
             scroll, which is the honest tradeoff for never rendering
             either panel unusably small.
          This still MUST be a definite `height` (not `min-height`) for
          the same reason as before: dockview-react's root renders
          `height: 100%` down its own wrapper chain, which only resolves
          against an ancestor with a definite (not min-) height. The
          `max(...)` CSS function (not Tailwind's arbitrary-value min-h
          alongside a separate h-, which cannot express "whichever of
          these two is bigger" in one definite value) is what makes both
          the floor and the viewport-bound behave as ONE definite
          height.

          Vertical-space reallocation pass (owner-authorized overshoot,
          2026-09-11): at a typical ~1000-1100px viewport the 640px floor
          was the effective governor (100vh - chrome-h regularly landed
          below it), and Positions/Orders needed internal scrolling to
          show 2 rows while real whitespace sat unused below this box and
          above the footer. Two changes together, matching the footer/
          wrapper-padding reclaim above:
          1. Floor raised 640 -> 760 (+120px) — deliberately well past
             "just enough," per the owner's explicit go-further-then-trim
             instruction, rather than another few-pixel nudge.
          2. +32px added to the viewport-bound term — the exact pb-6->
             pb-2 (16px, this file) and footer py-4->py-2 (16px, App.tsx)
             reclaim, folded in here so it isn't left an unaccounted-for
             page margin.
          Both numbers are deliberately generous; this was NOT re-measured
          against a live-rendered page (no browser access from this
          pass) — see the worked pixel math in the accompanying report,
          and dial back the floor first if it overshoots in practice. The
          640px floor's own honest scroll tradeoff (comment above) still
          applies at the new 760px value on short viewports.

          Sash-past-the-floor pass (owner bug report, 2026-09-11, round 2):
          this height was still a hard ceiling — see the
          WORKSPACE_DEFAULT_HEIGHT block comment above for the mechanism
          and the fix. `h-[...]` below keeps providing the resting default
          (still a definite height, still viewport-bound, unchanged from
          the pass above) via Tailwind/CSS as before; the inline `style`
          only ever ADDS to it once `growth` is nonzero, and inline
          `style` always wins the cascade over the class regardless of
          specificity, so there's no fight between the two. */}
